PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
To have entered, more fully than I have done,
into the events and fighting prior to the Retreat
from Cabul, would have proved unsuitable for the
purpose of my story, and for these events I must
refer the reader to history or the newspapers of the
time.
</p>

<p>
An officer of the Queen's 44th Regiment escaped
death in the Khyber Pass in the mode narrated in
its place, by wrapping the regimental colour round
him; and strange and varied as the adventures of
Captain Waller may appear, after the last fatal stand
was made by our troops, some such incidents actually
occurred to a Havildar of the Shah's Ghoorka
Regiment, after its complete destruction in Afghanistan,
so there is much that is real woven up with
my story.
</p>

<p>
Fiction, according to Sir Francis Bacon, infuses
in literature that which history denies, and in some
measure satisfies the mind with shadows, when it
cannot enjoy the substance&mdash;the shadows of an ideal
world.  "Art is long and life is short, so we do
wisely to live in as many worlds as we can."

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE TIME WILL COME.
</h3>

<p>
"<i>Le jour viendra</i>&mdash;it is the motto of our
family&mdash;given to us by Henry VI.  'The day will come,'"
said old Lord Lamorna, proudly, as he lay back in
his easy chair, with his elbows resting on the arms
thereof, and the tips of his upraised fingers placed
together, as if he was about to pray; "and most
applicable is that motto to you, nephew Richard,
for I am sure that when you are my age you will
regret not having taken my advice."
</p>

<p>
Richard Trevelyan smiled, but looked somewhat
uneasily at his younger brother Downie.
</p>

<p>
"You are too rich to throw yourself away, and
too well-born even for the most highly accomplished
daughter of a cotton-lord, or knighted mill-owner,"
resumed his stately old uncle, sententiously; "a
fellow knighted too probably for dirty ministerial
work; but assume a virtue if you have it not, and
let us see you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, my lord&mdash;excuse me, my dear uncle.
I have no desire to&mdash;to marry; why you&mdash;yourself&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't cite me, Richard.  You are only forty-three,
if so much" (and here, for the information
of our young lady readers, we may mention that
Richard is not the hero of these pages).  "I am
past seventy, yet I may marry yet, and do you all
out of the title," added Lamorna, with a laugh like
a cackle.
</p>

<p>
"My brother Dick is certainly the most listless of
men," said Downie, as he selected some grapes with
the embossed scissors, and filled his glass with
chateau d'Yquem.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think that I am so," retorted Richard.
</p>

<p>
"Downie is right," said Lord Lamorna.  "Why
do you not go into Parliament?&mdash;I have two snug
pocket boroughs here in Cornwall&mdash;and on one
hand attack routine and red-tapeism like a Radical;
on the other hand, denounce retrenchment and
cowardly peace-at-any-price, like a Tory of the old
school.  You would certainly be popular with both
parties by that <i>r√¥le</i>, and do good to the country at
large."
</p>

<p>
"I have no turn for politics, uncle."
</p>

<p>
"Diplomacy then&mdash;many of our family have
figured as diplomats; I was ambassador to Russia,
after Waterloo, and in the olden time more than
one of our family have been so to the Courts of
Scotland, France, and Brandenburg; and I trust
we all refuted the axiom of Sir Henry Wotton,
'that an ambassador was an honest man sent abroad
to lie for the good of his country.'"
</p>

<p>
"I have no taste for diplomacy."
</p>

<p>
"What the devil <i>have</i> you a taste for?" asked
his uncle, testily; "not domestic life, as I can't get
you to marry, like Downie here; and you soon left
the army, or tired of Her Majesty's service."
</p>

<p>
Richard flushed for a moment, and held his full
wine glass between him and the light, as if to test
the colour and purity of its contents.
</p>

<p>
"I know what bachelor London life is&mdash;another
style of thing, of course, from yours, Downie&mdash;that
which someone calls the hard-working life, which
begins at two P.M. one day, and ends at four
A.M. next morning.  There are the parks; the club, with
its bow-window; flirtations at balls and assemblies;
the opera, and parties to Greenwich; and then there
is the darker picture of doing business with old
Messrs. Bill Stamp and Cent.-per-Cent., in some
dingy little den off the Strand.  A bad style of
thing it is to meddle with the long-nosed fellows
in the discounting line; just as bad as&mdash;and often
the sequence to&mdash;running after actresses or
opera-singers.  You may love them if you like; but, great
Heavens! never stoop to the madness of committing
matrimony with any of them, or for a moment forget
the family to which you belong, and the ancient title
that is your inheritance."
</p>

<p>
All this was said with undisguised point and
pomposity; the cold grey eyes of Downie Trevelyan
had a strange, sour smile in them; and Richard's
face grew more flushed than ever now.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was over in the stately dining-room of
Rhoscadzhel; Mr. Jasper Funnel, the portly, florid,
and white-haired butler, had placed the glittering
crystal decanters before his master, who, with two
nephews, Richard and Downie Trevelyan, were
lingering over their wine; while in the western
light of a September evening, through the tall
plate-glass windows that reached from the richly-carpeted
floor to the painted and gilded ceiling, the Isles of
Scilly&mdash;the Casserites of the Greeks, the rocks
consecrated by the pagan Cornavi to the Sun&mdash;could
be seen at the far horizon, literally cradled in
the golden blaze of his setting in the sea; for the
house of Rhoscadzhel, in which our story opens,
stands near the Land's End, in the brave old
Duchy of Cornwall.
</p>

<p>
Audley Trevelyan, tenth Lord Lamorna, took his
title from that little bay or cove which was one of
the most romantic spots on the bluff Cornish coast,
until it was unfortunately selected by certain
utilitarian speculators as a site for granite works;
and near it is a place called the Trewoofe, a triple
entrenchment having a subterranean passage, wherein
Launcelot Lord Lamorna, with some other Cornish
cavaliers, hid themselves in time of defeat from the
troopers of Fairfax, as the tourist may find duly
recorded in his "John Murray."
</p>

<p>
He was in his seventieth year; pale in face and
thin in figure, and with his accurate evening
costume, for his valet always dressed him for dinner
even when alone, the old peer in every gesture and
tone displayed the easy bearing of a polished man
of the world, and of the highest bearing&mdash;keen but
cold, calm and unimpressionable.
</p>

<p>
He had yet much of the wasted beau about his
appearance; he wore rosettes on his shoes and
still adhered to a frilled shirt front and black
watered silk ribbon for his gold eye-glass, with a
coat having something of the high collar and cut
peculiar to the days when George IV. was king.  His
features were fine and delicately modelled; his nose
a perfect aquiline, with nostrils arched and thin,
his snow-white hair was all brushed back to conceal
the bald places and to display more fully a forehead
of which he had been vain in youth from a fancied
resemblance to that of Lord Byron.  In short the
Apollo of many a ball-room was now indeed a lean
and slippered pantaloon, but still careful to a degree
in costume and all the niceties of cuffs and studs
and rings.
</p>

<p>
Calm and self-possessed as he appeared, when now
lying back in his down easy-chair, sipping his iced
wine and playing with the diamond that glittered on
his wasted hand, and which had been a farewell gift
from the Empress of Russia, he had been much of
a <i>rou√©</i> in his youth, and consequently was not
disposed to enquire too closely into the affairs of his
nephew.
</p>

<p>
Downie Trevelyan was already married, nearly
to his uncle's satisfaction, his wife being the
daughter of a poor but noble family; and as for
Richard, he might run away with as many humble
girls as he chose, provided he did not marry any of
them, or make that which his haughty uncle and
monetary patron would never forgive&mdash;a <i>m√©salliance</i>;
for Lord Lamorna was a man full of strong
aristocratic prejudices, and a master in all the
tactics of society, and of his somewhat exclusive, and
occasionally selfish class.
</p>

<p>
His lordship's false teeth&mdash;a magnificent Parisian
set that had cost him some fifty guineas&mdash;would
have chattered at the idea of any member of his
family making a mistake in matrimony.  He had
heard ugly whispers about Richard, but never could
discover aught that was tangible.  If it existed,
Heavens! how were Burke, Debrett and Co. to
record it when the time came that it could no
longer be concealed?
</p>

<p>
Should any <i>m√©salliance</i> be the case, he had
vowed often that the barren title should go
without one acre of land to his eldest nephew; and
he would have willed that past him too had it been
in his power to do so; but though a sordid Scottish
Earl of Caithness once sold his title to a Highland
Chieftain, and caused one of the last clan-battles to
be fought in Scotland, such things cannot be done
now.
</p>

<p>
The old man had one ever present, ever prevailing
idea&mdash;the honour and dignity of the family&mdash;the
Cornish Trevelyans of Rhoscadzhel and Lamorna.
</p>

<p>
His two nephews were men in the prime of life,
but Downie was three years younger than his
brother.
</p>

<p>
Richard Pencarrow Trevelyan, the elder and
prime favourite with their uncle, was a remarkably
handsome man, with fine regular features that
closely resembled those of the old peer; but
Richard had been reared at Sandhurst, been in the
army and seen much of a rougher life than his
uncle.  He had a free bold bearing, an ample chest,
an athletic form and muscular limbs, which riding,
shooting and handling the bat and the oar had all
developed to the full, and which his simple
costume,&mdash;for he was fresh with his gun and his game-bag,
from the bleak Cornish moors and mountain
sides&mdash;advantageously displayed.
</p>

<p>
His dark blue eyes that were almost black, and
seemed so by night, had a keen but open expression,
his mouth suggested good humour, his white and
regular teeth, perfect health, and his voice had in it
a chord that rendered it most pleasant to the ear.
Dark eyebrows and a heavy moustache imparted
much of character to his face.
</p>

<p>
His brother, Downie Trevelyan, had never been an
idler like Richard.  Educated at Rugby and Corpus
Christi, Oxford, he had been duly called to the bar
by the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn, and
was now in good practice as a Barrister in London.
He had all the air and bearing of a gentleman of
good style; but he was less handsome than Richard;
had less candour of expression in eye and manner;
indeed, his eyes were like cold grey steel, and were
quick, restless, and at times furtive in their glances;
and they never smiled, even when his mouth seemed
to do so.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Richard, he was closely shaven, all save a
pair of very short and legal looking whiskers.  To
please his uncle was one of the unwearying tasks of
his life; and even now, with this view, he was in the
most accurate evening dress, thus affording a
complete contrast to the rough and unceremonious
tweed-suit worn by his brother&mdash;his coat broadly
lapelled with black silk <i>moir√©</i>, his vest with three
buttons, <i>en suite</i> with his shirt studs, which were
encrusted with brilliants.  His cold formality of
manner rendered his periodical visits to Rhoscadzhel
somewhat dull to Lord Lamorna, for somehow
few people cared much for Mr. Downie Trevelyan.
He had married judiciously and early in life,
and had now several children; and thus, while
joining his uncle in reprehending or rallying Richard
on his supposed anti-matrimonial views, his cold,
pale eyes, were wandering over the appurtenances,
the comforts and splendour of that magnificent
apartment, in which he was mentally appraising
everything, from the steel fire-irons, to the gold and
silver plate that glittered on the carved walnut wood
side-board, whereon were displayed many beautiful
cups, groups and statuettes (race-trophies of Ascot,
Epsom and other courses) which had been won in
Lamorna's younger days, when his stud was second to
none in England, and certainly equal to that of Lord
Eglinton in Scotland; yet he had never been a
gambler, or a "horsey man," being too highly
principled in one instance, and too highly bred in
the other; and so we say, while the legal eyes of
Downie appraised all, he thought of his eldest son,
Audley Trevelyan, then a subaltern in a dashing
Hussar Regiment, and marvelled in his heart, if he
should ever reign as Lord of Rhoscadzhel, manor
and chace, with all its moors and tin-mines.
</p>

<p>
"You were right to marry young, Downie," said
the old lord, resuming the theme of their conversation
after a pause, adding, as if he almost divined
the thoughts of his younger nephew, "your boy
Audley is, I hear from General Trecarrel, a
handsome fellow."
</p>

<p>
"He is a perfect Trevelyan, my lord," replied
Downie, who was studious in always according the
title to his relative, "and then my daughter, Gartha,
bids fair to equal her mother, who was one of the
handsomest women in London."
</p>

<p>
"To see your family rising about you thus, must
afford you intense pleasure, Downie; but I cannot
understand our friend Dick here at all.  My years
may not be many now, and I do not wish my hereditary
estate to change hands often, or my lands to be
scattered even after I am done with them."
</p>

<p>
"I do not comprehend your fears, my dear
uncle," said Richard, smiling; "your estates can
never lack heirs while God spares me&mdash;and then
there is Downie&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And his son Audley the Hussar&mdash;you would say?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," replied Richard, but in a strange faint
voice, and as he spoke he felt that the keen grey
eyes of Downie were regarding him attentively by
the waxen lights of the chandelier, which Mr. Jasper
Funnel and two tall footmen had just illuminated,
at the same time drawing the heavy curtains of
crimson damask over the last flash of the setting
sun, and the ruddy sea whose waves were rolling in
blue and gold, between the bluffs of Land's End and
the rocky Isles of Scilly.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot be a woman-hater, Dick?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;far from it," replied Richard, as a soft
expression stole over his manly face; "there can be
no such thing in nature."
</p>

<p>
"The truth is&mdash;but take your wine&mdash;I strongly
fear, that during your military peregrinations, you
have got yourself entangled now&mdash;and unworthily
perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"My lord&mdash;you are mistaken," replied Richard
firmly&mdash;almost sternly; "but what causes you to
think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Your so decidedly declining an introduction to
General Trecarrel and his two daughters&mdash;the most
beautiful girls in the duchy of Cornwall.  They
come of a good family too; and as the couplet has
it:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'By Tre, Pol, and Pen,<br />
  Ye may know the Cornish men.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The General resides somewhere near
Porthellick, does he not?" asked Downie, who saw
that his brother was changing colour, or rather
losing it fast.
</p>

<p>
"Some one told me, Dick, that it was rumoured
you got into a scrape in Edinburgh, 'that village
somewhere in the North,' as one of our humourists
calls it; it was to the effect that your landlady had
fallen over head and ears in love with her handsome
lodger, who was ditto ditto in her debt, and had to
soothe her ruffled feelings and settle her bill, by
matrimony at sight."
</p>

<p>
"An utter scandal!" said Richard, now laughing.
"Your allowance to me, ever since I left the Cornish
Light Infantry, has been too generous for such a
catastrophe ever to occur."
</p>

<p>
"And next came a story, that when you were at
Montreal with the regiment, you made a precious
mess of it with some pretty girl, and&mdash;to use
Downie's phraseology&mdash;parted as heart-broken
lovers, to figure as plaintiff and defendant at the
bar."
</p>

<p>
"Worse still and as false, my lord!" exclaimed
Richard, now pale with suppressed passion.
</p>

<p>
"Don't look so darkly, Richard," said Lord
Lamorna, who saw the flash in his nephew's dark
blue eyes; "I have had a pretty little box at
Chertsey, and a villa at St. John's Wood in my day,
when my friends, raven-tressed, or golden-haired as
the case might be, were amiable and tenderly
attached&mdash;but deuced expensive; so I must not be
severe upon you," added the old man, with his dry
cackling laugh.  "It is not these kind of little
arrangements I fear, but a <i>m√©salliance</i>; and there
are scandals even in London&mdash;yes, even in the
mighty world of London, though there they soon
die; they don't live and take root, as in the
so-called purer air of the country."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot understand all those vague hints, tales
and rumours, or who sets them afloat," replied
Richard, making an effort to preserve his calmness.
</p>

<p>
Downie saw the veins rise in his brother's
forehead while their uncle had been speaking; and he
smiled a quiet smile, as he bent curiously over his
glass.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Full many a shaft at random sent,<br />
  Finds mark the archer never meant;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and he could see that some of the random remarks
in the present conversation, rankled deeply in
Richard's breast; and that this conversation had
verged, more than once, on somewhat dangerous
ground.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it is a marvel to me, Richard, how a
handsome fellow like you can have escaped so long,
known as you are to be the heir to my title and
estates," continued the old lord, still harping on the
same topic: "for the girls now go in for winning in
matrimony, as we used to do at Ascot and
Epsom."
</p>

<p>
"How, my lord?" asked Downie, as if he had
never heard the joke before.
</p>

<p>
"By a neck&mdash;a bare neck and bosom added;
witness the beautiful and aristocratic demi-mondes
at the Opera!  Elizabeth was the first English-woman
who, to excite admiration, exposed her
person thus.  The virgin queen wore a huge ruff
certainly; but it stuck up <i>behind</i> her, she was
<i>d√©collet√©e</i> enough in front."
</p>

<p>
"I prefer her Scottish rival&mdash;collared to her
pretty neck, and sleeved to the slender wrist," said
Richard Trevelyan; "by Jove, I should not have
cared for flirting with a woman who carried a fan in
one hand and a hatchet in the other."
</p>

<p>
"Our ancestor, Henry Lord Lamorna, was
governor of Rougemont Castle, in Devonshire,
under Queen Elizabeth," said the peer pompously;
"but having married the daughter of a simple
knight in Surrey, he lost Her Majesty's favour
at Court, and had to live in retirement here at
Rhoscadzhel.  Let that mistake be a warning to
you, Richard."
</p>

<p>
"It happened pretty long ago," replied Richard,
laughing; "and at forty years of age I am surely
unlikely to commit an act of folly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If it be not committed already?"
</p>

<p>
&mdash;"And lose your favour, even by marrying, 'the
daughter of a simple knight.'"
</p>

<p>
"With my favour you would lose this fine estate.
But give me your hand, Dick, I know you will never
do aught unworthy of our good old Cornish name of
Trevelyan!"
</p>

<p>
With a grand old-fashioned air&mdash;yet one full of
kindness&mdash;the proud old man presented his thin
white hand to his nephew, who pressed it
affectionately, and then rose to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
"Whither go you, Dick, so soon?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;anywhere, uncle," replied the other,
wearily.
</p>

<p>
"How, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Merely into the lawn to enjoy a post-prandial
cigar," replied Richard, whose face wore an evident
expression of annoyance, as he bowed and quitted
the room.
</p>

<p>
"We have worried him, I fear," said Downie,
with a self-satisfied smile.
</p>

<p>
"Don't use slang&mdash;it is bad in tone," replied his
uncle; "but I cannot make your brother out&mdash;I
hope he is not deceiving us all.  Gad, if I thought
so&mdash;if that Montreal story should prove true&mdash;&mdash;"
the peer paused, and his keen blue eyes flashed
with anger at the vague thoughts that occurred to
him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do not fear, my lord," said Downie
Trevelyan, in a suave and soothing manner; "though
sham diamonds often do duty for real ones."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" asked his uncle, haughtily.
</p>

<p>
Downie only smiled, and bent over his glass of
Burgundy again.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Neb na gare y gwayn call restona,</i>" said Lord
Lamorna, significantly; "I hate proverbs: but this
is a good old Cornish one; 'he that heeds not gain,
must expect <i>loss</i>.'  When do you expect your oldest
boy home from India?"
</p>

<p>
"He may arrive next week, perhaps, my lord, and
he will at once dutifully hasten to present himself
to you."
</p>

<p>
"He must be well up among the Lieutenants of
the Hussars now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yet he means to exchange into the Infantry."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a matter of expedience and expense, my
lord; even with forage, batta, tentage, and so forth,
he finds his regiment a very extravagant one."
</p>

<p>
"I shall give him a cheque on Coutts and Co.,
for I must not forget that you did me the honour to
name him after me."
</p>

<p>
"But you did us the greater honour in being his
sponsor&mdash;and in bestowing upon him a gold
sponsorial mug."
</p>

<p>
"With the <i>Koithgath</i> of the Trevelyans for a
handle, and another perched on the lid; well,
well&mdash;he may be my successor here&mdash;who knows, who
knows," mumbled the old man, as he prepared to
take his-after dinner nap, by spreading a cambric
handkerchief over his face, and Downie glided
noiselessly away to the library, with a strange and
unfathomable smile on his colourless face, and he
muttered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I too may say&mdash;'the time will come!'"

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
RHOSCADZHEL.
</h3>

<p>
On the smooth lawn his brother was walking to
and fro, with a cigar between his firm white teeth,
with his heart a prey to bitter and exciting thoughts;
and though Richard Trevelyan is not, as we have
said, the hero of these pages, to the lawn we shall
accompany him.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce can be the secret spring of all
this intrusive solicitude upon my uncle's part about
having me married, as if I were a young girl in her
third season?" he muttered; "I have often feared
that Downie suspected me&mdash;as a lawyer, it is natural
he should suspect every one of something more than
he sees or knows; and yet&mdash;I have been so wary,
so careful!  My poor Constance&mdash;still concealment&mdash;still
dissimulation for the present, and doubts of
our future!  No hope for us, save in the death of
that old man, ever so good and kind to me.  Did
he really but know Constance, how sweet and
gentle she is!  A curse be on this silly pride of
birth and fortuitous position which is our
bane&mdash;this boasting of pedigree old as the days of Bran ap
Llyr, the ancestor of King Arthur.  By Jove, it is too
absurd!" and he laughed angrily as he tossed away
his cigar and then sighed, as he surveyed the fa√ßade
of the stately mansion, and cast his eyes round the
spacious lawn that stretched far away in starlight
and obscurity.  "And yet must I stoop to this senile
folly," he added, half aloud; "for 'twere hard
to see all these broad acres go to Downie's boy, the
Hussar, past me and mine!"
</p>

<p>
The seats of the Cornish aristocracy have usually
little to boast of in architecture; but the mansion
of Rhoscadzhel* was an exception, being a rare
specimen of a fine old Tudor dwelling, which had
suffered more from the rude hand of civil war, than
from "time's effacing fingers," and was built,
tradition avers, from the famous quarry of Pencarrow,
and of good Cornish freestone.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Cadzhel, Cornish for castle.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A massive iron gate, between carved pillars, each
surmounted by a koithgath, or wild cat, rampant&mdash;a
crest of which Lord Lamorna was as vain as ever
was old Bradwardine of his heraldic bears&mdash;gave
access to the avenue, a long and leafy tunnel that
lay between the house and the highway leading to
the Land's End.  The branches of the stately old
elms were interlaced overhead, like the groined
arches of a Gothic cathedral and a delightful
promenade their shade afforded in the hot days of
summer, when only a patch of blue sky, or the
golden rays falling aslant, could be seen at times
through their foliage.
</p>

<p>
Engrafted in the later Tudor times upon the
ruins of Rhoscadzhel, of which there is still
remaining the fragment of a loopholed tower and
ponderous granite arch shrouded in ivy, with its
modern <i>porte-coch√®re</i> and vestibule floored with
marble, its mullioned windows filled in with plate
glass in lieu of little lozenge-panes, its dining hall
and drawing rooms lighted with gas when such
was the wish of its proprietor, the mansion, though
retaining all the characteristics of the days when
Queen Bess held her court at Greenwich and
danced before the Scottish ambassador, had nevertheless
all the comforts, appliances and splendour,
with which the taste and wealth of the present age
could invest it.
</p>

<p>
The great dining-hall had remained almost
unchanged since the days of the first Charles.  Its
vast chimney-piece, which rose nearly to the ceiling,
was covered with marvellous scrolls and legends,
and innumerable wild cats' heads among them, over
all being the arms of Trevelyan of Lamorna; <i>gules</i>,
a demi-horse <i>argent</i> issuing from the sea, adapted
from the circumstance of one of the family
swimming on horseback from the Seven Stones to the
Land's End, when they were suddenly separated
from the continent by a terrible inundation of the
ocean, and as this dangerous reef is no less than
nine miles from Scilly, where a light-ship points
it out to the mariner, the feat was well worthy of
being recorded, at least in heraldry.
</p>

<p>
The furniture here was quaint and old, massive
and richly carved, and though the vast
stone-flagged chamber, where many a Cornish cavalier
has whilom drunk "confusion to Cromwell and the
Rump," and where still stands the great dining
table with its da√Øs, where of old "the carles of
low degree" had sat below the salt, is sombre and
gloomy, somewhat of lightness is imparted by the
splendid modern conservatory that opens off it,
with marble floor and shelves of iron fret-work
laden with rare and exotic plants.
</p>

<p>
It boasts of a chamber known as "the Queen's,"
wherein Henrietta Maria had slept one night before
she fled to France, and since then no one has ever
occupied the ancient bed that, like a huge catafalque,
stands upon three steps in the centre of the wainscoted
room which like several others in Rhoscadzhel,
has hangings of faded green tapestry, that are lifted
to give entrance; and where the hearths, intended for
wood alone, have grotesque andirons in the form
of the inevitable koithgath on its hind legs.  And
on the walls of these old chambers hung many a
trophy of the past, and many a weapon of the
present day, from the great two-handed sword
wielded by Henry Lord Lamorna at the Battle
of Pinkey down to the yeomanry sabre worn by
the present peer at the coronation of George IV.,
a peer of whose effeminacy the said Lord Henry
would have been sorely ashamed.
</p>

<p>
And many a Vandyke, Kneller, and Lely were
there, with portraits of the Trevelyans of past times,
who now lay under their marble tombs in yonder
little church upon the hill, where among dust and
cobwebs hung their helmets, spurs, and gauntlets,
and the iron mace of one Launcelot Trevelyan,
who was a man of vast stature; and it is as great
a source of wonder to the village children as the
rickety ruin of a gilded coach which at certain
times is drawn forth to the lawn and aired
carefully, being that in which the grandfather of
the present peer brought home his bride in patches
and powder, and it is supposed to be the first
vehicle of the kind ever seen in the duchy of
Cornwall.  Thus, as Richard Pencarrow Trevelyan
thought over all these possessions with their
traditional and family interests, of which, by one
ill-natured stroke of the pen, his proud uncle
might deprive him and his heirs for ever, a bitter
sigh escaped him.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the quaint fa√ßade of the ancient house,
from the mullioned windows of which, half hidden
by ivy and wild roses, there streamed out many
a light into the darkness, his eyes wandered to
the fertile fields, all bare stubble now, to the wide
open moor overlooked by many a wooded tor, and
to the beautiful lawn, in the centre of which stands
one of those wonderful <i>logan-stones</i>, so peculiar to
Cornwall and Brittany, a ponderous, spheroidal
mass of granite, so exquisitely balanced that it may
be oscillated by the touch even of a woman's hand;
and as he turned away to indulge in deeper reverie
by the shore of the adjacent sea, he raised his right
hand and his glistening eyes to the stars, as if some
vow, as yet unuttered, was quivering on his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" he exclaimed, "please God and pray
God, the time will come; but not as my good uncle,
and not, as the careful Downie, anticipate.
Marriage! how little do they know how, in the great
lottery of life, my kismet&mdash;as we used to say in
India&mdash;has been fixed&mdash;irrevocably fixed!"

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE ALARM BELL.
</h3>

<p>
The season was autumn now, and on the
succeeding day&mdash;the last he meant to spend at
Rhoscadzhel for some time at least&mdash;Richard Trevelyan
appeared in the breakfast parlour again in shooting
costume, with a scarlet shirt having an open collar,
and with a brown leather shot-belt over his shoulder;
while his uncle, who, even when at his slender
morning repast, in his elaborately flowered dressing-gown,
wore accurately fitting pale kid gloves on his
shrivelled hands, for such things were a necessity
of the old lord's existence; thus he glanced again
with an air of annoyance at the dress worn by his
eldest nephew, as he considered it a solecism,
decidedly in bad taste, and that something more
was due to his own presence.
</p>

<p>
Downie's costume, a fashionable morning coat
came more near his lordship's ideas of propriety.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Jasper Funnel, in accurate black, was at the
side-table, to slice down the cold meat, pour out the
coffee from its silver urn into the beautiful Wedgewood
cups, and to carve the grouse and other pies;
for Cornwall is peculiarly the land of that species of
viand, as there the denizens make pies of everything
eatable, squab-pies, pilchard-pies, muggetty-pies, and
so forth.
</p>

<p>
"I heard last evening the new chime of bells you
have put up in Lamorna Church," said Richard, as
he seated himself and attacked a plate of grouse, the
recent spoil of his own gun; "how pleasantly they
sound.  Who rings them?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say&mdash;never inquired," replied the old
peer, testily; "I can only tell you one thing,
Richard."
</p>

<p>
"And that is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They were wrung out of my pocket by the vestry."
</p>

<p>
At this little quip, Downie obsequiously and
applaudingly laughed as loudly as he was ever known
to do, and just as if he had never heard it before.
</p>

<p>
"However, I need not grudge the poor people
their chime of bells; I am rich enough to afford
them more than that, and occupying as we do a
good slice of this <i>Land of Tin</i>, for so the Phoenicians
named this Cornish peninsula of ours as early as
the days of Solomon, we have its credit to maintain;
but bring us home a well-born and handsome bird,
Dick, and I shall have the bells rung till they fly to
pieces&mdash;by Jove I will!  Only, as I hinted last
night, let her be worthy to represent those who lie
under their marble tombs in that old church of
Lamorna; for there are bones there that would
shrink in their leaden coffins if aught plebeian were
laid beside them."
</p>

<p>
Richard shrugged his shoulders, and glanced round
him with impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Let us look forward, my dear uncle," said he;
"in this age of progress all men do; and of what
account or avail can a dead ancestry be?"
</p>

<p>
Downie smiled faintly, and Lord Lamorna frowned
in the act of decapitating an egg, for to his ears
this sounded as rank heresy or treason against the
state.
</p>

<p>
"By heavens! nephew Richard, you talk like a
Red Republican.  With these socialistic views of
equality, and so forth, I fear you will never shine in
the Upper House."
</p>

<p>
"I have no desire to do so; you see how simple
my tastes are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In dress decidedly too much so."
</p>

<p>
"And how happy and content I am to lead the
life of a quiet country gentleman; and have done
so ever since I left the Cornish Light Infantry."
</p>

<p>
"Your demands upon my pocket are certainly so
moderate, that I cannot think you are playing me
false, Dick," said the peer, with a pleasant smile;
"egad, if I thought you were doing so, I'd have you
before the Mayor of Halgaver, as our Cornish folks
say!"
</p>

<p>
"Trust me, my good uncle," replied Richard
Trevelyan, with a glistening eye, and laying a hand
caressingly on the old man's shoulder, as he rose
and adjusted his shot-belt; "and now I go to have
a farewell shot on the moors."
</p>

<p>
"Why a farewell shot? you have been here barely
a fortnight."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, I must leave Rhoscadzhel tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
"Positively?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, uncle."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me," continued Lamorna, drily; "but
may we inquire for where?"
</p>

<p>
"Oxford&mdash;and then town after, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Oxford&mdash;and town too," replied his uncle,
testily; "the last time you left this for London,
if General Trecarrel was right, you were seen for a
month after in his neighbourhood; and, if his story
were true&mdash;and I dare not doubt it&mdash;you did not
get beyond the border of Cornwall&mdash;and were
certainly not so far as Devonshire."
</p>

<p>
"Trecarrel was, I hope, mistaken," urged Richard.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, too."
</p>

<p>
Richard's face was pale, and to conceal his emotion,
he stooped and caressed his favourite pointer, which
had bounded in when the butler opened the door;
and soon recovering from his little agitation&mdash;whatever
its secret source might be&mdash;he politely and
affectionately bade his uncle "good-bye for the
present," nodded to the silent and observant Downie,
took a double-barrelled breech-loader from the
gun-room and sallied forth, unattended by game-keepers,
desiring quite as much to indulge in reverie
and enjoy a solitary ramble, as to have a shot at a
passing bird.
</p>

<p>
To Richard it seemed that he had read a strangely
keen, weird and unfathomable expression in his
uncle's eyes, as they followed his departing steps
on this particular morning&mdash;an expression which,
somehow, haunted him.
</p>

<p>
The season, we have said, was now autumn, and
a tender, mellow tone rested over all the landscape;
Richard Trevelyan was fond of the strange, wild
district&mdash;the land of old tradition, of bold and varied
scenery&mdash;amid which his youth and so much of his
manhood had been passed, and he looked around
him from time to time with admiring eyes and
an enthusiastic heart.
</p>

<p>
A soft warm shower had fallen that morning
early, refreshing the fading September leaves in the
belts of coppice that girt the upland slopes, and in
the orchards, where the ripe golden apples were
dropping amid the thick sward below.  Above the
purple, and often desolate moors which are so
characteristic of Cornish scenery, and where the
small breed of horses, the little black cattle and
sharp-nosed sheep of the province were grazing,
the wooded <i>tors</i> or hills stood boldly up in the
distance, their foliage in most instances presenting
many varied tints.  There were the brown madder,
the crisped chesnut, and the fading beech, the more
faded green of the old Cornish elm, and the russet
fern below, from amid which at every step he took
the birds whirred up in coveys; while Richard, lost
in reverie&mdash;the result of his uncle's remarks of
late&mdash;never emptied a barrel at them, but walked slowly
on looking round him from time to time, and filled
with thoughts that were all his own as yet.
</p>

<p>
The place where he loitered was very lonely:
here and there a gray lichen-spotted druidical
monolith stood grimly up amid the silent waste;
in the distance might be seen the gray expanse of
the ocean, or some bleak looking houses slated with
blue, as they usually are in Devon and Cornwall,
or perhaps some of those poorer huts, which, like
wigwams, have cob-walls; <i>i.e.</i> are built of earth, mud,
and straw, beaten and pounded together, just as
they might have been in the days of Bran the son
of Llyr, or when Arthur dwelt in Tintagel.
</p>

<p>
Richard Trevelyan threw himself upon a grassy
bank, and his pointer, doubtless surprised by his
neglect of all sport, lay beside him with eyes of
wonder and tongue out-lolled.  In the distance,
about a mile or so away, Trevelyan could see
Rhoscadzhel House shining in the morning sunlight;
and again, as on the preceding evening, he
looked around with a bitter smile upon tor and
moorland, and on the wondrous druid monoliths
that stand up here and there on the bleak hill sides,
each and all of them having their own quaint name
and grim old legend.
</p>

<p>
How came each to be there?  "Without patent
rollers; nay, without the simplest mechanical
contrivances of modern times, how was so huge a mass
transported to yonder desolate and wind-swept
height?  How many yoke of oxen, how many
straining scores of men must it have taken to erect
the least of them!  What submission to authority,
what servile or superstitious fear must have
animated the workers!  No drover's whip would have
urged to such a task; no richest guerdon could
have repaid the toil; yet there the wonder stands!"
</p>

<p>
And some such thoughts as these floated through
the mind of Richard, as his eyes wandered from a
cromlech or slab that rested on three great stones,
to a vast <i>maen</i> or rock-pillar, that might be coeval
with the days when Jacob set up such a stone to
witness his covenant with Laban.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I ever wander here with Constance&mdash;and
if so, when," thought he; "assuredly not while my
uncle lives; but his death&mdash;how can I contemplate
it, when he is so good, so kind, so tender, and so
true to me?  Oh, let me not anticipate that."
</p>

<p>
How often in autumn, in the gloomy mornings
of November, had he pursued the fox over these
desolate moors, often breakfasting by candle-light
in his red coat on a hunting morning, to the great
boredom of old Jasper Funnel?
</p>

<p>
What joy it would be to gallop over that breezy
wind-swept moor, with Constance by his side!  To
walk with her through yonder dense old thicket,
and tell her that every tree and twig therein were
her own; to drive by yonder cliff, Tol Pedn Penwith,
the western boundary of a beautiful bay, and
where in the summer evening, the forty Isles of
Scilly seemed to be cradled in the glory of the
western sun; to show her all these places with
which he was so familiar, and perhaps to tell their
children in the years to come&mdash;for all Richard's
habits and tastes were alike gentle and domestic&mdash;the
old Cornish legends of Arthur's castle at Tintagel,
of the magic well of St. Keyne, and of Tregeagle
the giant&mdash;the bugbear of all Cornish little
people; the melancholy monster or fiend, who
according to traditions still believed in, haunts the
Dozmare Pool, from whence he hurled the vast
granite blocks, known as his "quoits," upon the
coast westward of Penzance Head; the deep dark
Pool, his dwelling place, is said to be unfathomable
and the resort of other evil spirits.
</p>

<p>
Desolate and begirt by arid and dreary hills, it
presents an aspect of gloomy horror; and then when
the winter storms sweep the moorland wastes, and
the miners at the Land's End, deep, deep down in
mines below the sea, hear the enormous boulders
dashed by it on the flinty shore overhead, above all
can be heard the howling of Tregeagle!  For ages
he has been condemned to the task of emptying the
Dozrnare Pool by a tiny limpet-shell, and his cries
are uttered in despair of the hopelessness of the
drudgery assigned him by the devil, who in moments
of impatience, hunts him round the tarn, till he flies
to the Roche Rocks fifteen miles distant, and finds
respite by placing his hideous head through the
painted window of a ruined chapel, as a bumpkin
might through a horse-collar; for these, and a
thousand such stories as these, are believed in
Cornwall, nor can even the whistle of the railway
from Plymouth to Penzance scare them away.
</p>

<p>
Richard Trevelyan was smiling when he remembered
how often he and Downie, when loving little
brothers and playfellows, had been scared in their
cribs at night by stories of Tregeagle; and of that
other mighty giant who lies buried beneath Carn
Brea, where his clenched skeleton hand, now
converted into a block of granite (having five
distinct parts, like a thumb and fingers) protrudes
through the turf.
</p>

<p>
He could recall the dark hours, when as fair-haired
children, they had cowered together in one of the
tapestried rooms of Rhoscadzhel, and clasped
each other's hands and necks in fear of those
hob-goblins, which people the very rock and cavern, and
even the very air of Cornwall.  Downie was a man
now, legal in bearing, and cold-blooded in heart.
Richard had painful doubts of him, and remembered,
that, strangely enough his hand <i>alone</i>, had always
failed to rock the logan-stone in the lawn before
Rhoscadzhel, and such monuments of antiquity,
have, according to Mason, the properties of an
ordeal&mdash;the test of truth and probity:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold yon huge<br />
  And unhewn sphere of living adamant,<br />
  Which, poised by magic, rests its central weight<br />
  On yonder pointed rock: firm as it seems,<br />
  Such is its strange and virtuous property,<br />
  It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch<br />
  Of him whose heart is pure; but to a traitor,<br />
  Tho' e'en a giant's prowess nerv'd his arm,<br />
  It stands as fixed as Snowdon!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Even the childish hands of his little daughter
Gartha, could rock the logan-stone, when Downie's
failed to do so.  Why was this?  Was there indeed
any truth in the ancient test of integrity and purity
of heart; or was it but an engine of religious
imposition?  And now amid these unpleasant
speculations, there came to the loiterer's ear, the
tolling of a distant bell.
</p>

<p>
He started up, and listened.
</p>

<p>
It was, beyond a doubt, the house-bell of Rhoscadzhel,
and was being rung violently and continuously,
for the breeze brought the notes distinctly
over the furzy waste.
</p>

<p>
What could have happened?  Fire&mdash;or was he
wanted in haste?  Was his uncle indisposed; were
his fears, his hopes and wishes, though blended with
sorrow, to be realised at last?
</p>

<p>
His breath came thick and painfully, and he
remembered with something of foreboding&mdash;for his
Cornish breeding rendered him superstitious and
impressionable&mdash;that as he had passed Larnorna
church that morning, he had seen, on the rough
lichstones at the entrance to the sequestered
church-yard, a coffin rested prior to interment, while the
soft sad psalmody of those who had borne it thither&mdash;a
band of hardy miners&mdash;floated through the still
and ambient air; for the custom of bearing the dead
to their last resting place with holy songs&mdash;a usage
in the East, as old as the fourth century&mdash;is still
observed in Cornwall, that land of quaint traditions
and picturesque old memories.
</p>

<p>
Springing to his feet, Richard Trevelyan discharged
both barrels of his gun into the air, and
hurried in the direction of the manor house.
</p>

<p>
As he drew nearer, the sonorous clangour of the
great bell, which was now rung at intervals, but with
great vigour, continued to increase, adding to the
surprise and tumult of his heart, and the perturbation
of his spirit.

CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
POWDERED WITH TEARS.
</h3>

<p>
A mounted footman, who approached him at full
speed, pulled up for a moment and respectfully
touched his hat, for he was one of the Lamorna
household.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" asked Richard.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir&mdash;oh, Mr. Richard&mdash;my lord is taken
very ill."
</p>

<p>
"Ill&mdash;my uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"He is quite senseless, and Mr. Downie Trevelyan
has sent me for the doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Then ride on and lose no time," replied Richard,
as he hastened to the house, where he found
confusion and dismay predominant, the servants
hovering in the vestibule, conversing in whispers and
listening at the library door, while Jasper Funnel
and Mrs. Duntreath, the old housekeeper (a lineal
descendant of the Dolly Duntreath, so well-known
in Cornwall), were mingling their sighs and regrets
for the loss of so good a master.
</p>

<p>
"Where is my uncle?" asked Richard, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"In the lib&mdash;lib&mdash;library," sobbed the housekeeper,
with her black silk apron at her eyes, and as
Richard advanced, Jasper Funnel softly opened the
door.  The favourite nephew entered the long
spacious and splendid apartment, which occupied
nearly the entire length of one of the wings of
Rhoscadzhel, its shelves of dark wainscot filled by
books in rare and magnificent bindings, with white
marble busts of the great and learned men of
classical antiquity looking calmly down on what was
passing below.
</p>

<p>
The fire-place wras deep and old; but a seacoal
fire was burning cheerily in the bright steel modern
grate; and as if he was in a dream, seeing the far
stretching lawn, with its tufts of waving fern and
stately lines of elm and oak, as he passed the tall
windows noiselessly on the soft Turkey carpet,
Richard drew hastily near the great arm-chair, in
which his uncle was seated, dead&mdash;stone-dead, with
Downie, somewhat pale and disordered in aspect,
bending over him!
</p>

<p>
The old man had suddenly passed away&mdash;disease
of the heart, as it proved eventually, had assailed
him while seated at his writing-table.
</p>

<p>
On Richard's entrance and approach, Downie
hurriedly took from the table and thrust into his
pocket, a document which looked most legally and
suspiciously like a "last will and testament;" but
quick though the action, Richard could perceive that
the document, whatever it was, had no signatures of
any kind.
</p>

<p>
Richard knelt by his uncle's side; he felt his
pulses; they had ceased to beat; his heart was cold
and still, and there came no sign of breath upon the
polished surface of the mirror he held before the
fallen jaw; with something of remorse Richard
thought,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No later than this morning I deceived him&mdash;and
he loved me so&mdash;was ever my friend and second
father!&mdash;I thought," he added aloud, to Downie,
"that his eyes wore an unusual expression this
morning&mdash;a weird, keen, farseeing kind of look,
such as I never read in them before."
</p>

<p>
"I fancied that I perceived some such expression
myself, and consequently, at his years, was the less
alarmed, or shall I say shocked, when in the very
act of speaking to me, a sudden spasm came over
his features&mdash;a deep sigh, almost a faint cry escaped
him, and he sank back in his chair, when just about
to write.  See, there is the pen on the floor, exactly
where it fell from his relaxed fingers."
</p>

<p>
Richard's honest eyes were filled with tears, and
mechanically he picked up the pen and laid it on the
desk.
</p>

<p>
"Writing, say you, Downie; and what was he
writing?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I cannot say&mdash;a letter to his steward, I
believe."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;I see no letter."
</p>

<p>
"He was just about to commence it," replied
Downie, whose usually pale face coloured a little.
</p>

<p>
"And that paper you pocketed in such haste,
Downie, what was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, Richard, that can concern you
(by-the-by, you are Lord Lamorna now!) or that
fair one whose portrait you exhibit so ostentatiously
just now."
</p>

<p>
Richard started, alike at the title so suddenly
accorded to him by his brother, and at the reference
to the portrait, for in the confusion or haste, as he
bent over his dead uncle, a little miniature, which
he wore at a ribbon round his neck, depicting a very
beautiful dark-eyed woman, had slipped from his
vest, and with an exclamation of annoyance, he
hastened to conceal it.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Who</i> is the lady, Richard?" asked Downie.
</p>

<p>
"As yet, that must remain my secret," replied
Richard; "a little time, my dear fellow, and we
shall have no mysteries among us."
</p>

<p>
Downie, secretly, was not ill-pleased by this
diversion, in which Richard forgot the subject of
the paper.
</p>

<p>
The doctor soon came&mdash;a village practitioner&mdash;fussy
and full of importance; but nevertheless
skilful; and he decided that disease of the
heart&mdash;a malady under which, though ignorant of its
existence, the deceased had long laboured&mdash;had
proved the immediate cause of death.  The poor
shrivelled remains of the proud old lord were conveyed
to the principal bed-room of the mansion, and there
laid in a species of state, upon a four-posted bed,
that rose from a da√Øs, and was all draped with black.
His coronet and Order of the Bath, together with
that of St. Anne, which he received when ambassador
in Russia, were deposited at his feet upon a crimson
velvet cushion, that was tasseled with gold; while
two tall footmen in complete livery with long canes
draped with crape, mounted guard beside the coffin
day and night, to their own great disgust and annoyance,
till the time of the funeral, of which Richard
took the entire charge; and which, in a spirit of
affection and good taste, he resolved should be in all
respects exactly what the deceased peer would have
wished it to be.
</p>

<p>
The features of the latter became, for a time,
young and beautiful in their manliness and perfect
regularity, while all the lines engraven there by Time
were smoothed out, if not completely effaced.
</p>

<p>
"How like our father, as I can remember him, he
looks!" whispered Downie, more softened than usual,
by the hallowing presence of death.
</p>

<p>
But Richard was thinking of another face whom
the dead man resembled&mdash;a young and beloved face
to him.
</p>

<p>
"Denzil did you say?" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"I said our father," replied Downie, sharply.
</p>

<p>
"True, he died young," was the confused
reply.
</p>

<p>
"Your mind wanders, surely?" said Downie, with
a dark and inexplicable expression in his now
averted face; but Richard saw it not, he was simply
taking a farewell glance of one who had loved him
so well; his manly heart was soft, and his dark-blue
eyes were full with the tears of honest affection
and gratitude.
</p>

<p>
So Audley Lord Lamorna was dead, and all now
turned to Richard as their new and future master;
all the blinds in Rhoscadzhel were drawn down by
order of Mrs. Duntreath, and all went about on
tiptoe or spoke in subdued voices, especially Downie,
who in his heart thought that Richard was spending
"far too much in ostrich feathers, crimson coffins,
and other mummery," among undertakers, and
heraldic painters, too; but he was more politic than
to say so&mdash;even to his wife, who, with her daughter
Gartha, a pretty girl in her teens, had been on a
visit to General Trecarrel, and now duly arrived to
act as mistress of the mansion, <i>pro tem.</i>, during the
solemnities of which it was to be the scene.
</p>

<p>
She was warmly welcomed by Richard Trevelyan;
she was his only brother's wife, and he had none of
his own to take her place there&mdash;as yet.
</p>

<p>
A peevish and foolish woman of fashion, who
had once possessed undoubted beauty, Mrs. Downie
Trevelyan was generally treated as a kind of cypher
now by her husband; but nevertheless he consulted
her at times, on certain matters of common interest.
She still clung tenaciously to the tradition of her
former beauty, and sought to retain it by the aid
of pearl powder, the faintest indication of rouge
perhaps, and by the prettiest of matronly headdresses
made of the costliest lace.  She was always
languid, somewhat dreary, and spent most of her
time with a novel in one hand, and a magnificent
little bottle of ether, or some strong perfume, in
the other.  To Richard her society was decidedly a
bore; but at this crisis he was full of business, and
occupied by a depth of thought that was apparent
to all.
</p>

<p>
Six tall servants in mourning scarfs, and in the
livery of the Trevelyans, bore upon their shoulders
the crimson velvet coffin containing the remains of
the late lord, to the vault where his forefathers lay,
and where many of them had been interred by
torchlight, in times long past.
</p>

<p>
There was something feudal, stately, and solemn
in the aspect of the procession, when between two
lines of all the tenantry, standing bare-headed, it
wound down the old avenue, where the leaves were
almost as thick, the sun as bright, and the birds
singing as merrily as they might have been when
Lord Launcelot rode there by the Queen's bridle,
or when he and his cavaliers fled from Fairfax to
seek shelter in Trewoofe; and so his descendant
Audley was laid at last, where so many of his
predecessors lie side by side, "ranged in mournful
order and in a kind of silent pomp," each coffin
bearing the names, titles and arms of its mouldering
occupant.
</p>

<p>
Pondering on who might stand here when his
turn came to be lowered down there, Richard, the
new lord, stood at the head of the tomb, pale, and
with more emotion than met the eye; Downie stood
on his right hand, and the heir of the latter, well
bronzed by the sun of India, on his left, three of his
younger brothers, held with a ribbon.  Their old
friend, General Trecarrel, stood grimly and erect at
the foot.  The vault was closed, and the body of
Audley, tenth Lord Lamorna, that frail tenement,
which he had petted and pampered, of which he
had been so careful and so vain, for some seventy
years, was left to the worms at last!
</p>

<p>
The assemblage dispersed, and the world went on
as usual.
</p>

<p>
The bell of the village church, which had all
morning tolled minute strokes, ceased; and after a
time the new chimes rang out a merry peal in
honour of his successor.  It was in Cornwall as
at St. Cloud; <i>le Roi est mort&mdash;vive le Roi!</i>
</p>

<p>
The old general, who had no fancy for a mansion
of gloom, departed, and took back with him
Downie's son Audley, a jolly young subaltern,
whom we shall soon meet elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
But prior to this departure, there had been the
reading of the will, an affair of great solemnity, in
the library, the same apartment where the late lord
died; and his solicitors, Messrs. Gorbelly and
Culverhole, a fat and a lean pair of lawyers, felt
all their vulgar importance on the occasion.
</p>

<p>
There were a few handsome presents to old and
faithful servants, including Jasper Funnel and
Mrs. Duntreath (whose sobs became somewhat intrusive),
and Richard found himself Lord of Rhoscadzhel
and Lamorna, with an unfettered fortune of thirty
thousand per annum; while Downie had a bequest
of less than the third of that sum, together with some
jewelry, including the Russian diamond ring for his
wife and daughter Gartha.
</p>

<p>
So whatever had been the object or the tenor of
that document which the astute barrister had so
evidently prepared, and which he had thrust into
his pocket so hastily and awkwardly on that eventful
morning, Richard was as safely installed in the
estates as in his hereditary title; and the moment
he found himself alone, he became immersed in
letter-writing.
</p>

<p>
Opening the crimson morocco blotting pad which
his uncle had last used, and which had his coronet
and crest, the wild-cat, stamped in gold thereon,
he saw some words written in his brother's hand,
and these, on investigation proved to be, "This is
the last will and testament of me, L&mdash;&mdash;" (doubtless
Lord Lamorna); further on, as if at the bottom
of the page, he could detect the name of "Porthellick,"
and a dark flush of passion crimsoned the
face of Richard.  He thought again of the
document he had seen in Downie's hand; their uncle
could certainly never have signed it, but some
painful doubts&mdash;added to intense sorrow for their
existence&mdash;grew strong in Richard's heart, which
was a true and generous one.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Constance&mdash;my long suffering darling!"
he muttered, almost aloud; "the day is now near when
all your doubts and my dissimulation to the world
shall end.  Thank God, the time has almost come."
</p>

<p>
And he rode forth, to post with his own hand a
letter he had written.
</p>

<p>
He was barely gone ere Downie, who had been
quietly observing his motions, also made an
investigation of the blotting pad which Richard had just
closed, and therein he saw what seemed to be the
address of a recent letter.  He held the pink sheet
between his eyes and the light, and read clearly
enough, "Mrs. Devereaux, Porthellick Cottage."
</p>

<p>
And the lawyer smiled sourly, but with great
uneasiness, nevertheless, and he muttered aloud,
</p>

<p>
"I had but vague suspicions before&mdash;and now all
my knowledge has come too late&mdash;too late!"
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry to hear you say so, dear," said
his graceful little wife, the rustle of whose
fashionable mourning suit he had been too much
preoccupied to hear, as she glided into the library, in
search of one of the many uncut novels that now
littered the tables; "sorry chiefly for the sake of
our dear Audley, and Gartha, and the other little
ones."
</p>

<p>
"Your know to what I refer&mdash;the succession; it
may not be so hopeless or irreparable as we
think."
</p>

<p>
"But your uncle died with his will unchanged."
</p>

<p>
"True; I pressed upon him lately my belief that
Richard had formed that&mdash;of which he had a horror
so great&mdash;a <i>m√©salliance</i>&mdash;in fact, a low or improper
attachment for one beneath us in rank and name.
My uncle's fury became great, and to take advantage
of the time, I placed before him a will, leaving all
his estates, as he had a hundred times threatened
to do, to me and mine.  I had the document ready
written, and placed it before him; but as fate
would have it, in his pride, fury, and resentment, a
spasm seized the old man, and he fell back dying,
actually with the pen in his hand, after I had dipped
it in that silver inkstand and placed it between his
fingers."
</p>

<p>
"How extremely unfortunate!" said Mrs. Downie
Trevelyan, placing her scent-bottle languidly to her
little pink nostrils.
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunate?  It was a narrow chance by which
to lose thirty thousand a year!" said Downie, grinding
his teeth, while his eyes gleamed like two bits of
grey glass in moonlight.  "There is some mystery
about Richard's life; moreover, he wears a woman's
miniature at his neck."
</p>

<p>
"Young&mdash;is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;yes&mdash;she seems so."
</p>

<p>
"And pretty?" added Mrs. Downie, glancing at
herself in a mirror.
</p>

<p>
"Very."
</p>

<p>
"His intended, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope she is not more than that; but time
must soon show now."
</p>

<p>
And over the porte-coch√®re of Rhoscadzhel there
now hung a vast lozenge-shaped hatchment or
funeral escutcheon, the sight of which would have
delighted him, whose memory it was meant to
honour, being the achievement of a bachelor peer,
representing the arms of Lamorna in a shield
complete&mdash;the demi-horse <i>argent</i> of the Trevelyans
rising from the sea; over all, the baron's coronet,
crest, motto, and mantling, collared by the Orders
of the Bath and St. Anne; and after some old
fashion, retained still only in Germany, Scotland,
and France, the herald-painter had depicted at
each corner a death-head, while all the black
interstices were <i>powdered with tears</i>.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
PORTHELLICK VILLA.
</h3>

<p>
More than forty miles distant from Rhoscadzhel,
on that part of the Cornish coast which is washed
by the waves of the Bristol Channel, at a place
named Porthellick, or the Cove of Willows, was a
beautiful white-walled villa, built in the Greek style
of architecture, with an Ionic portico of six carved
and painted wooden pillars.  Its windows opened
in the French fashion, and descended to the floor;
luxuriant creepers, jasmines, and sweet brier, were
trained on green trellis-work around it, and rare
plants of gorgeous colours grew in stone vases,
which were placed in a double row along the smooth
gravelled terrace, from which the basement of the
cottage rose&mdash;for the villa was a cottage in
character, being but a one storeyed dwelling, though
spacious and handsome, and having a noble
conservatory and coach-house and stabling, and an
approach of half a mile in length, bordered by
a double line of those magnificent willows from
which the place took its name, and affording,
from the principal windows in front, an ample
view of the sea, with ever and anon, a white sail
lingering in the dim blue distance, or a passing
steamer, with its pennant of smoke, streaming
astern, as it sped towards Ireland or the Isle
of Man.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of that day when Lord Lamorna
died so suddenly, a lady was standing under the
portico of this house, looking anxiously, not
seaward, but inland, towards the willow avenue, by
which her residence was approached from the road
that leads by Stratton, among the hills, towards
Camelford and Wadebridge, near the rocky valley of
Hanter-Gantick.
</p>

<p>
The lady looked repeatedly at her watch, consulted
a railway time-table, and entered the house,
only to return to her post, and bend her eyes in
anxious gaze along the avenue.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Devereaux, for it was she, was
young-looking&mdash;marvellously so for her years; she seemed to be
quite a girl still; yet she was fully four-and-thirty,
and the mother of two children.  This youthful
appearance doubtless arose from her very petite
and slender figure; her strictly fashionable style
of dress, and the piquante beauty that shone in
the minute features of her charming little face.
Her eyes were dark, yet full of light and sparkle,
though their long lashes imparted a great softness
of expression.  Her eyebrows were very dark and
well-defined&mdash;some might have deemed them too
much so; but they imparted great character to
her face.  Her mouth and chin were perfect; her
teeth like those of a child; and over all, her
face, figure, and bearing, even to every motion of
her hands and feet, Mrs. Devereaux was exquisitely
lady-like.
</p>

<p>
"At last&mdash;at last they come!" she exclaimed;
"and yonder is my dear, dear Denzil, whom I have
not seen for so many, many months," she added, as
her eyes filled with tears, and her soft cheek flushed
with all a mother's joy.
</p>

<p>
As she uttered her thoughts aloud, a little
basket-phaeton, drawn by two lovely cream-coloured
Shetland ponies, was seen bowling down the avenue of
pale green willows; a young lady was handling the
ribbons of these Lilliputian steeds in a very masterly
style; and beside her sat a young man, attired in
fashionable travelling costume, who was alternately
waving his cap and a newspaper, which he flourished
so vigorously, that the sleek, brindled cattle grazing
in the clover meadows close by, lifted their great
brown eyes as if inquiringly, while the little drag,
with its varnished wheels flashing, dashed along
towards the villa, the walls of which shone white
as snow in the evening sunlight.
</p>

<p>
The phaeton was reined up before the portico,
when a handsome lad of eighteen, with fine regular
features, dark blue&mdash;almost black&mdash;eyes, and short
fair curly hair, sprang out, and was instantly clasped
to his mother's breast.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mamma&mdash;we have such news for you!"
exclaimed the young lady, who seemed an exact
reproduction of Mrs. Devereaux in height and face,
though barely seventeen, with dark eyes and hair;
"oh, such news!" she added, in high, girlish
excitement, as she tossed her whip and reins to a
groom who came promptly from the stable-yard,
Derrick Braddon, once a soldier in Richard's regiment&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Surely mamma knows all," said the youth;
"have you not seen the <i>Gazette</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Gazette</i>?" repeated Mrs. Devereaux, growing
very pale, as she led her son caressingly into the
little morning-room, where a hasty repast had
been prepared for him and his sister, and
which opened off a handsome little vestibule,
hung with fox-brushes crossed, the trophies of
many a hunting day, brought home by his father,
"Captain Devereaux."
</p>

<p>
"Denzil is now an officer, mamma," said the
young girl, throwing off her hat and looking
admiringly at her brother; "I was just in time to
meet him at the train."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mamma&mdash;I was yesterday gazetted to an
ensigncy in the Cornish Light Infantry,&mdash;got leave
from Sandhurst, and at once came right slick down
here.  Oh, how proud papa will be&mdash;is he not
here?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Mrs. Devereaux, faintly; "and how
does your name appear in the <i>Gazette</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Here it is, mamma, dear," replied the youth,
pointing to the paper he had been flourishing, and
feeling proud to see his name, for the first time, in
print.  "'Cornish Light Infantry; Lieutenant
Audley Trevelyan, from the 14th Hussars, to be
lieutenant, vice Gascoigne, killed in action.  Denzil
Devereaux, gentleman cadet, from the Royal Military
College, Sandhurst, to be ensign, vice Foster,
deceased.'  And now, mamma, I am done at last
with all the boredom of Euclid and fortification,
Trigonometry, and all the rest of it."
</p>

<p>
"And you will soon be done with poor mamma, too!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, mamma, dear; that can never, never be!"
replied the lad, as he threw his arms round her neck
and kissed away the tears that were already oozing
from her long and beautiful eyelashes; "but I do
so wish papa were at home&mdash;I have so much to tell,
and so much to ask him!"
</p>

<p>
"Denzil&mdash;Devereaux?" said the mother, ponderingly,
and as if to herself.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mamma; and few fellows at Sandhurst had
more marks opposite their names than Denzil
Devereaux, for I worked hard that I might choose
my own regiment; so I chose the 32nd because I am
a kind of Cornish man, and because it was papa's old
corps.  Oh, how pleased he will be!"
</p>

<p>
"And where is the regiment stationed now?"
asked Mrs. Devereaux, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"In India."
</p>

<p>
"India?" she repeated, mechanically, as if that
separation, which is but as a living death, had
already begun.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder who the Audley Trevelyan figuring
along with me in the <i>Gazette</i>, may be.  It is a pure
Cornish name."
</p>

<p>
His mother was weeping now, and Sybil, who had
hitherto been silent, began to do so from sympathy;
for already, so we have said, the pang of the coming
parting was felt, and the maternal heart was wrung
at the thought of a long and doubtful separation
from her only son&mdash;her Denzil&mdash;whom she deemed
beautiful as Apollo, and clever as the admirable
Crichton; for the Overland Route had not been
opened, there was no electric cable to India, and its
nearest point was distant a six months' journey by sea
round the Cape; and so, full of aching thoughts that
her children could not share&mdash;thoughts that must be
all her own till her husband returned&mdash;poor
Mrs. Devereaux could only fold her son to her breast and
weep, till the young man's military and boyish
enthusiasm became dulled, and his naturally warm and
affectionate heart grew full with a perplexity that was
akin to remorse, for seeking to leave her side and
push his way in the world as a soldier.  Yet that
was the only career his father had ever indicated to
him.
</p>

<p>
"A letter from papa&mdash;our dear papa!" exclaimed
Sybil, glad to cause some diversion from the gathering
gloom, as she caught the missive from the hand
of the village postman, who appeared outside the
open window.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if he has heard of my appointment,"
surmised Denzil, his thoughts reverting to their old
channel.
</p>

<p>
"It is sealed and edged with black!" exclaimed
Sybil; "and&mdash;how singular&mdash;it bears the Penzance
postmark!"
</p>

<p>
"How is this, mamma&mdash;I thought papa was in
London?" asked Denzil.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Devereaux trembled violently, as she tore
open the letter, and muttering an excuse hastily left
the room with it.
</p>

<p>
"What's up," said the ex-cadet, as he applied himself
to the sherry decanter; "by Jove, Sybil, this is a
strange way of receiving papa's letter.  Who is dead,
I wonder&mdash;I hope there is nothing wrong with him,
anyway!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, can he have met with an accident?"
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely, as the letter is written by himself; but
to be at Penzance when we all thought he was in
town&mdash;very odd, isn't it?"
</p>

CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
RICHARD'S MYSTERY.
</h3>

<p>
To explain much that the reader may have
begun to suspect or misjudge, we must now go
back a few years, into the private life of Richard
Trevelyan.
</p>

<p>
When stationed with his regiment in Montreal he
had made, at some public assembly, the acquaintance
of Constance Devereaux, then a girl fresh from
school.  He was fascinated by her rare beauty, and
a certain <i>espieglerie</i> of manner, which the thoughts
and cares of future years eventually crushed out of
her; and she, on her part, was dazzled by the
attentions of a handsome and wealthy young officer; for
Richard being his uncle's favourite nephew and heir,
received from him a handsome yearly allowance, in
addition to that which he inherited from his father.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately Constance Devereaux, with all her
beauty and accomplishments, was the daughter of
one who would have been deemed of very humble
caste indeed, if judged by the standard applied to
such matters at Rhoscadzhel.  The girl loved him
passionately and blindly, and little foreseeing all such
a step would cost her in the end, she consented to a
private marriage; so they were united in secret by
P√®re Latour, the catholic cur√© of the chapel of
St. Mary, near Montreal; an acolyte of the chapel and
Richard's servant, a soldier named Derrick Braddon,
being the only witnesses.
</p>

<p>
The marriage was duly registered in the books of
the little church, and an attested copy was lodged
with the cur√© who performed the ceremony; but as
the regiment was ordered soon after to another
colony, it was left in his hands for the time.
</p>

<p>
Richard obtained leave of absence, and soon after,
much to his uncle's surprise, left the army by selling
out, and led a kind of wandering life on the
Continent, taking his wife's name of Devereaux, the
better to conceal from the proud, and as yet
unsuspecting old lord, the <i>m√©salliance</i> he had
formed&mdash;a union, however; of which he had never cause to
repent, for his wife was gentle and tender, and
possessed many brilliant mental qualities; but well
did Richard know that if that union were discovered,
the immense fortune, which was at Lord Lamorna's
entire disposal, would be left, if not altogether to
Downie, to others, and past himself and the heirs of
his line; and that such a calamity should not occur
he became more anxious and more solicitous after
the birth of two children, a son whom he named
Denzil, after his own father, and a daughter, Sybil,
born to them since their wanderings in Italy.
</p>

<p>
Many difficulties attended the course of this secret
matrimonial life!  Even in their continental travels,
when seeking the most secluded places, stray
English tourists would come suddenly upon them if
they ventured near a table d'h√¥te; once or twice an
old brother officer, or other people who knew or
recognised in the so-called Captain Devereaux,
Richard Trevelyan; and then mysterious nods or
knowing smiles were exchanged, and odd whispers
went abroad in the clubs of London and
elsewhere&mdash;innuendoes that would have withered up the heart
of Constance had she heard them.
</p>

<p>
She knew all that might be suspected, and felt
that the positions of herself and her children, were
alike false and liable to misconstruction; that
malignant scandal might be busy with the names of
them all.  But the die was cast now, and she had
but to suffer and endure; to pray and to wait the
death of the poor old man who was so kind to her
husband, and who loved him so well&mdash;yet not well
enough to forgive&mdash;had he ever discovered it&mdash;the
deception which had been practised upon him and
upon society.
</p>

<p>
Repining in secret, sorrowing for the falsehood of
her position, knowing that her husband, the father of
her children, passed in the world as an eligible
bachelor, the object of many a designing mother,
open to the attentions, the coquetries and captivations
of their daughters, aware that he resided with
her only by stealth and under another name than his
own, Constance had indeed much to endure, though
rewarded in some degree therefor, to see her
children growing up in health and beauty, each a
reproduction of their parents, for Denzil had all the
personal attributes of his father, with much higher
mental qualities, while the soft-eyed Sybil possessed
all the dark beauty, the petite figure and lady-like
grace of Constance herself.
</p>

<p>
The latter, we have said, was but the daughter of
a Canadian trader; yet amid all the ease and luxury
with which her husband's ample means and tender
love supplied her, there were times, when she could
not but murmur in her heart at the anomaly of
her situation, so different from the honest security
of her father's humble home, and her native pride
revolted against it; and with this pride there grew a
species of shame, which she felt to be totally
unmerited, and then she felt an utter loathing for
the very name of Lord Lamorna, (though it should
one day be borne by her own husband) as being the
cause of all her secret suffering, her dread of the
present and doubt of the future.
</p>

<p>
On the education of their children, Richard, who
doted on them, had spared nothing.  Both were
highly accomplished, and wherever they had
wandered they had the most talented masters that
wealth could procure.  Now Denzil had taken the
highest prizes at Sandhurst and was gazetted to a
Regiment of the Line, and was going forth into
the world under the false name of Devereaux!
</p>

<p>
How was this to be altered&mdash;how explained and
rectified?
</p>

<p>
A necessity for being much about Rhoscadzhel,
as being the heir to the estates and as his uncle's
years increased, had compelled Richard Trevelyan
to be more often present in his native county than
he had hitherto been; hence, he had settled his
secret ties in the pretty little villa of Porthellick, at
what he conceived to be a safe distance of some
forty miles or so from the residence of Lord
Lamorna.
</p>

<p>
In and about that villa he was simply known as
"Captain Devereaux," and as he had almost entirely
relinquished hunting and field sports&mdash;save an occasional
shot at a bird&mdash;and when there lived a retired
and secluded life; and as his wife and children
seemed to live for themselves and him only, making
friends with few save the poor and ailing, time
glided by, and the mystery of Richard's career was
never fully laid bare.
</p>

<p>
For those there are in this world (and his uncle
was one) who would have pardoned Richard making
Constance Devereaux his mistress, and yet would
mockingly have resented his making her a wedded
wife!
</p>

<p>
Lamorna's friend General Trecarrel&mdash;the representative
of one of the oldest families in Cornwall&mdash;who
lived near Porthellick, had met Richard on
horseback more than once in the vicinity of that
place, when he was supposed to be in London,
Paris, or elsewhere, and the mention of these
circumstances caused Mr. Downie Trevelyan, who, as
we have shown, had a keen personal interest in the
matter, to prosecute certain inquiries in that part
of the duchy, and the result led him to believe that
the Captain Devereaux who occasionally resided at
the Grecian Villa in the Willow Cove, and his
irreproachable brother Richard, were one and the same
person!
</p>

<p>
If it were so, the character of the lady must
be&mdash;he supposed&mdash;somewhat questionable; and
Downie knew right well that their uncle might
forgive a liaison, but never a marriage with one of an
inferior grade.  The conduct and bearing of the
lady at the villa seemed unimpeachable; so Downie
had long felt doubtful how to act, and only indulged
in vague hints to his brother's prejudice.
</p>

<p>
The pride and anger even these had kindled in
the heart of the old lord, who was now gone, and
the threats in which he had indulged, afforded
Richard Trevelyan a fair specimen of what would
assuredly be the result were his marriage ever
known at Rhoscadzhel; and when pressed on the
subject pretty pointedly, he had assured his
uncle&mdash;while his cheek flushed and his heart burned with
shame&mdash;that he was still unwedded and free; and
even as he made the false avowal, the soft pleading
eyes of Constance, his own true wife, and the voices
of their children, came vividly and upbraidingly to
memory!
</p>

<p>
Now the foolish old man had passed away, the
barrier was removed, and all should be made light
that had hitherto been darkness, as her husband's
hastily written letter informed her.
</p>

<p>
Yet she thought, with honest indignation, how
hard it was that she had been for all these eighteen
years and more kept out of her proper sphere as
the wedded wife of Richard Trevelyan, often taking
almost flight from <i>this</i> town and <i>that</i> hotel, lest he
should be recognised; consigned hence to a life of
secresy and seclusion; a life that might yet cast
doubts upon the very name and birth of her
children, through the whim, the old-fashioned pride
and folly of an absurd and antiquated peer, whose
ideas went back, even far beyond the days of his
youth, when people travelled in stage-coaches, used
sand and sealing-wax for letters; when steam and
telegraphy were unknown, when papers were
published weekly at sixpence; and was one who deemed
that railways, electricity, penny-dailies, and what is
generally known as progress, are sending all the
world to ruin.
</p>

<p>
Her husband's letter filled her with joy.  He
playfully added, "I fear I have drunk of the well of
St. Keyne before you," alluding to the well-known
spring near Liskeard, a draught from which the
Cornish folks suppose will ensure ascendancy in
domestic affairs, and the letter was signed for the
first time "Your loving husband, LAMORNA."
</p>

<p>
How strange to her eye the new signature looked.
She felt somehow that she preferred his old one of
"Richard."  But they were one and the same now,
and a little time should see her in her place, as
mistress of that stately dwelling, Rhoscadzhel, which
she had only seen once from a distance, and felt
then, with an emotion of unmerited humiliation,
that she could not, and dared not, enter.
</p>

<p>
Like all its predecessors, this letter, that
contained so much in a few lines, was addressed to her
as "Mrs. Devereaux," and she felt a momentary
pang, but remembered that to have addressed her
by the title, which was now so justly hers, might
have sorely perplexed the rural postman of her
neighbourhood.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
LADY LAMORNA.
</h3>

<p>
It was a difficult task for Constance Devereaux
to conceal her undeniable joy from her affectionate
and observant son and daughter; and her heart
would sometimes upbraid her that she should feel
thus happy on an occasion which must cause them
all to wear mourning, the external livery of at least
conventional woe.
</p>

<p>
Denzil and his sister attributed her alternate fits
of radiance and silence to pleasure at the anticipated
return of their father, who on this occasion had
necessarily been longer absent than usual from the
Villa at Porthellick.
</p>

<p>
The equivocation and anxiety of years&mdash;years the
happiness of which had in it so much of alloy&mdash;were
about to be removed now!  She was at last
Constance Lady Lamorna of Rhoscadzhel&mdash;the
wife of him who represented one of the oldest, and
perhaps, most noble families in the duchy; but one
passage in her husband's letter troubled and
perplexed her, though it caused neither fear nor
doubt&mdash;of one kind at least&mdash;in her loving and trusting
heart.
</p>

<p>
"Our marriage must still be kept a secret for a
<i>little time</i>; when we meet, I shall tell you <i>why</i>."
</p>

<p>
After so much had been endured, and now when
the barrier had been swept away by death, why
should there be more secresy still&mdash;at a time so
critical for their Denzil, too?
</p>

<p>
For a week she tortured herself with endless
surmises which might have grown into actual fears
but for the arrival of her husband, looking so well
and so handsome, and though grave (for he had
loved his generous old uncle&mdash;his second father, as
he termed him), so evidently pleased and happy;
and Constance thought it fortunate that their son
and daughter were both absent, she had so much to
say and to hear.
</p>

<p>
Denzil had taken his rod and gone forth to fish
in some lonely tarn amid the moors, while Sybil
had driven away in the pony phaeton to visit some
friend at a distance.
</p>

<p>
"Here's his lord&mdash;&mdash;  the master himself, ma'am!"
said Derrick Braddon, who was the only human
being in England that shared their mystery, and
who was now "dying," as the phrase is, for
permission to share with others the great secret the
faithful fellow had kept so long and so well; and
now Dick's weather-beaten visage was radiant with
pride and pleasure as he ushered Richard into the
pretty little drawing-room, when, with a girlish
bound, Constance sprang into his open arms.
</p>

<p>
"Well, dearest Materfamilias," said he, kissing
her tenderly on the proffered lips and radiant eyes;
"you are looking as young and as charming as
ever&mdash;ay, even as on that eventful morning in
St. Mary's, at Montreal, a morning we may remember
now without fear, my own one!"
</p>

<p>
"So the poor old man is gone at last, and our
days of dissimulation are over," she replied,
sobbing amid the smiles that beamed on her up-turned
face.
</p>

<p>
"And you have acted wisely in not adopting deep
mourning yet."
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;wisely?" she asked, while perceiving
that her husband must have doffed his black
costume somewhere on the way to Porthellick, for
he was as usual attired in a shooting-suit and
brown-leather gaiters; and she felt an unpleasant
emotion by this circumstance, for whence this
continued caution, she thought; this care, this hateful
continuation of an alias, as it seemed, this playing
of a double character, if all were right and clear? and
now the passage in his letter flashed upon her
memory.
</p>

<p>
"I said 'wisely,' dearest Constance; because we
have still a part to play."
</p>

<p>
"Still?" she queried, mournfully, and her eyelids
drooped.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me&mdash;the children know nothing of this
change in our fortunes, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;and dear Denzil, you are aware, has
been&mdash;gazetted."
</p>

<p>
"To my old corps&mdash;so I saw; God bless the
boy?" exclaimed Richard Trevelyan; "yes, but
what I mean is, that I must bring you all before the
world&mdash;you as the wife, and them as the children, of
Lord Lamorna, with judicious care and a strength
of <i>conviction</i> that none can doubt or challenge."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Richard," said she, trembling, "I do not
understand you."
</p>

<p>
"Here, I am still known as Captain Devereaux;
but the world, which deems me a bachelor, must
be convinced that we were married to each other
in <i>faci√¶ ecclesi√¶</i>, as those lawyer-fellows have
it; and the proofs of that circumstance must be
forthcoming."
</p>

<p>
"Proofs?" she repeated, faintly, as she seated
herself, and grew very, very pale, for it seemed to
her over-sensitive mind, as if his manner had
become hard and sententious, even while he stooped
over, and tenderly and caressingly held in his, her
little hand whereon was the wedding ring that P√®re
Latour had consecrated; and now there ensued a
brief pause, for in his knowledge of her extreme
sensibility, and the amount of his own loving
nature, he feared the explanation of all he meant
might wound.
</p>

<p>
Though some might have deemed the secresy to
which he had condemned her for years (lest they
might lose the large fortune now theirs) selfish;
Richard Trevelyan had ever been nervously jealous
of her honour, and the honour of their innocent
children; and at times, he had accused himself of
moral cowardice in his submission to the caprice of
his uncle.  In his heart he had always cursed the
duplicity to which they had been compelled to
resort, and the false position in which that duplicity
had placed them all for such a length of time.  All
this was to be atoned for now; but he felt that it
must be done wisely, warily and surely, or, as he
had said, with <i>strength</i>, lest the world in which he
had hitherto moved as a bachelor&mdash;that selfish and
suspicious bugbear called "Society" might shrug
its shoulders, and ask, "Can all this story be true?"
</p>

<p>
He had some difficulty in explaining all this to
Constance, but, fortunately, what he lacked in tact,
he made up for in tenderness; yet, after a minute of
silence and tears, she exclaimed with uncontrollable
bitterness,
</p>

<p>
"I alone am to blame!  I ought to have foreseen
the difficulties with which I should encumber you;
but I was a simple, a trusting and a heedless
girl!&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nor has the trust of your girlhood been
misplaced, Constance," he urged.
</p>

<p>
"What Eden is without its serpent&mdash;what house
without its skeleton? and I am yours!"
</p>

<p>
"My darling Constance, do not speak thus, and
do not weep; think if Denzil or Sybil were to
return and see you thus agitated&mdash;see what they
never saw before, tears in your eyes; at least, tears
so bitter as these," urged her husband, as he caressed
her tenderly.  "You know, my own love, that solid
proofs of our marriage, beyond mere assertion,
<i>must</i> be forthcoming; and until these proofs are in
our hands, we must appear to the world as Captain
and Mrs. Devereaux; we must act wisely and warily,
I repeat, for the sake of our dear children."
</p>

<p>
The face of Constance became ghastly, and a
dangerous gleam, such as Richard had never seen
before, was in her dark eyes, while she said,
huskily,
</p>

<p>
"Honest Derrick Braddon witnessed our marriage, Richard."
</p>

<p>
"True; but I am now a peer of the realm, and I
wish the full proof of it all.  You know that during
the past year I have thrice written to the P√®re
Latour for the certificate of our marriage, but wrote
in vain, he has left my letters unanswered.  I might
employ those lawyers, Gorbelly and Culverhole to
sift the matter, but to use their aid, might set
abroad a scandal at once; hence I now propose to
start by the first steamer for America to get the
necessary documents in person, and Derrick
Braddon shall accompany me."
</p>

<p>
"And may not I?" she pleaded, softly.
</p>

<p>
"No, darling Constance, I shall be gone for more
than a month&mdash;for two, perhaps, and you have to
get Denzil fitted out for his regiment&mdash;my poor
Denzil, I shall grudge those two months' loss of his
society fearfully, as you may suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon my momentary bitterness, dearest
Richard, but after so much endurance, after such
long concealment&mdash;" her voice failed her, and
wreathing her soft arms round his neck, she nestled
her little head on his breast, and whispered with a
sigh, as if her heart would burst, "is it
irrevocable&mdash;and must I too, be separated from my boy?"
</p>

<p>
"It is but for a time, Conny&mdash;no young fellow
should be idle; and a year or so in the army&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And he will return, Richard&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As the son and heir of Lord Lamorna!"
</p>

<p>
"But oh, how I shall miss him!"
</p>

<p>
"You will have Sybil and me!"
</p>

<p>
"But you, too, I am about to lose."
</p>

<p>
"For a time only; and do not speak so
forbodingly, dear Constance."
</p>

<p>
"I felt such disappointment that Denzil should
appear at Sandhurst, and even in the Gazette, not
as a Trevelyan, but as a Devereaux!"
</p>

<p>
"And a Devereaux he deems himself, and must
continue to do so, till I return from Montreal.
Old Trecarrel is going in command to India, and
when matters are all squared here, I'll get Denzil
on his Staff with ease.  We have been the victims
of circumstances; have I not a thousand times said,
that if my uncle had discovered our marriage, we
should have lost all?  He is gone at last; but you
know, Conny darling, that his ideas were simply
absurd&mdash;in some respects suited only to the
middle-ages&mdash;the middle ages do I say?  By Jove, to those
when the Anglo-Saxons wore coats of paint, and
dyed their yellow hair blue.  But are things
arranged in this world wisely, think you, Constance?'
</p>

<p>
"I dare not impugn the plans of a beneficent
Providence."
</p>

<p>
"But Providence never meant the conditions of
life to turn out as they too often do."
</p>

<p>
"How, Richard," she, asked gently; "I don't
quite understand you?"
</p>

<p>
"That the greatest number of the rich, the powerful
and the most successful&mdash;by flukes, perhaps&mdash;are
fools or knaves."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but if riches brought talent&mdash;the wealthy
and powerful would be too happy, and Fate or
Providence do not make them so."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot express to you how my heart was wrung
with jealous envy, and even with shame, when I
saw Downie's family stand around my uncle's grave,
and enjoying all the freedom and hospitality of
Rhoscadzhel&mdash;even his cold-blooded, fashionable
wife, too&mdash;and thought how my own three tender
loves were debarred&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And unknown&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;&mdash;d&mdash;m it, unknown, and must be for a few
weeks still, but time cures all evils, and it will cure
this.  Yet is not the gazetting of the two cousins,
Denzil and the oldest of Downie's four boys, in one
paragraph, and to my old corps, too a remarkable
coincidence&mdash;all the more so, that they are ignorant
of each other's existence?"
</p>

<p>
"My poor Denzil&mdash;he is so bright and clever!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, more clever than ever I was.  In my time,
when I met you so happily in pleasant Montreal,
one could be a fair average soldier without all the
polyglot accomplishments so necessary now, when
he who quits Sandhurst as a candidate for a
commission direct, with five shillings and threepence
per diem to further his extravagance, might quite
as well come out for the Church or Bar, with
the chance of a safer and better paid berth in
either."
</p>

<p>
"And he joins his regiment as a Devereaux&mdash;my
poor boy!"
</p>

<p>
"Still harping on that string!" said Richard, a
little impatiently.  "On my return when matters
are all sorted and made clear by the legal documents,
Denzil and Sybil must be simply told, that
my succession to estates and a title have necessitated
a change of name."
</p>

<p>
"But our Denzil is no longer a boy&mdash;and I shall
almost blush for my past duplicity, before my own girl!"
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, Conny, this is foolish; what is
done cannot be undone, and it is useless to cry over
spilt milk."
</p>

<p>
"And how to explain this absence, for perhaps
two months, you say, when they have been longing
every hour for your return from London, where they
believed you to be?"
</p>

<p>
"I know not yet, Constance; but a little time
will make all things clear.  We had no marriage
contract&mdash;a love-sick subaltern and a schoolgirl
were not likely to think of such a thing&mdash;we had
only the brief certificate deposited with P√®re Latour;
but a will executed by me, in favour of you and the
children shall make all right and secure; and now
my little wife, for a biscuit and glass of dry sherry,
as I have ridden this morning all the way from
beyond Launceston."
</p>

<p>
Constance retired for a minute to bathe her eyes,
to smooth her hair, and came back to look composed
and smiling; for she had still to act a part.
</p>

<p>
The hour for which she had so pined and yearned&mdash;especially
since her son Denzil first saw the light
in a lonely village among the Apennines&mdash;the time
when she should take her place as the wife of
Richard Trevelyan, (not that she cared for the
wealth that place might bring her) had come; and
yet there were fresh delays to be endured by her,
and now it might be dangers dared by him she
loved so well; but he strove in his honest, manly,
and affectionate way to cheer her; and as he filled
his glass with the sparkling golden sherry, he kissed
her once more as if they were lovers still and said merrily,
</p>

<p>
"I drink to your speedy welcome home, my dear
little Lady Lamorna!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE BROKEN CIRCLE.
</h3>

<p>
Sybil who was clever with her pencil, made up
quite a collection of sketches from her portfolio, a
pleasant labour of love, for Denzil to take with him,
as a souvenir of herself and their beloved Cornwall,
and skilfully the girl's able hand and artistic eye
had reproduced the wondrous stone avenues of
Dartmoor and Merivale, the Stone Pillar of St. Colomb,
the Cliff Castles of Treryn, Tintagel and elsewhere,
with many a pretty and peaceful cottage scene.
</p>

<p>
Preparations for her husband's journey, and more
than all, the Indian outfit of Denzil, luckily occupied
the attention of Constance for a time; thus her
hands and those of Sybil were fully employed, and
the minds of both had no leisure to brood over the
coming separation.
</p>

<p>
Weary of the monotony of life at the villa, great
was the delight of old weather-beaten Dick Braddon,
to "be off" as he said, "to see the world once more
with the master," whom he loved only second
perhaps to Denzil, whose free frank bearing charmed
the veteran, who averred that he was exactly like
what his father was, when he joined the Cornish
Light Infantry, a cherry-cheeked ensign, long ago in
America.
</p>

<p>
But the hour of separation drew near, when both
father and son were to leave Porthellick, and depart
each upon their long watery journey;&mdash;the former
to America, and the latter to what seemed the other
end of the world&mdash;India; and the heart of Constance
began to sink in spite of herself.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Richard," she whispered once, with her soft
face nestling in her husband's neck, while his
protecting arm went kindly round her; "the greatest
joy on earth is to possess a child&mdash;the greatest woe
to lose it!  The loss of our parents we may, and
must, in the course of time anticipate; but the loss
of our children&mdash;never!"
</p>

<p>
"But Denzil will return, Conny&mdash;you would not
have the boy tied to your apron-strings, like Sybil?"
urged Richard, laughing to cheer and rouse her;
but, nevertheless, the rank, title and fair fortune
now before them all, the mother's anxious heart
foreboded sorrow in the future; and now came the
last night her boy was to sleep under his father's
roof, ere he was to go forth into the world&mdash;forth
like a branch torn from its parent stem.
</p>

<p>
When all were in slumber that night, poor Constance
stole in to watch her Denzil as he slept.  The
feeble rays of the night-lamp played on the features
of her boy, and on the glitter of a laced scarlet-coat
and gold epaulettes that hung on the pier glass.  With
the vanity natural to youth, he had been contemplating
himself in his Regimental finery ere he
went to repose, and his bullock-trunk and overland,
lettered for "India," were among the first things
that caught her eye, bringing more home to her
heart the fact of his departure.
</p>

<p>
He was still hers!
</p>

<p>
To-morrow he should be far away from her, out
on the great and stirring highway of life&mdash;her petted
boy no longer; and smiles, like ripples upon shining
water, seemed to spread over the smooth face of the
sleeping lad, even as the tears gathered in the eyes,
and prayer in the heart of the mother who watched
him for a time, with her hands clasped, and stole
away with many a backward glance, thinking how
lonely she should be when that hour on the morrow
came.
</p>

<p>
And this tall and handsome lad&mdash;this young
soldier going forth to carry the Queen's colours in
the distant East, was once her "baby boy," the
child she had borne, nursed and nurtured.  She had
a sweet and sad, yet proud and joyous consciousness
in this.  Had he been weakly, deformed or crippled,
she should have loved him all the same; but then,
thank God! her Denzil was so handsome.
</p>

<p>
Often in far-away lands, on weary marches, in
comfortless tents and rickety bungalows, on the
banks of the Sutlej, or amid hostile Sikhs and
Afghans, would he dream of the soft and loving
face that had been bent in silence over his&mdash;the face
he never more might see, save in those kind visions
that God sends in sleep, to soothe&mdash;it may be, to
sadden and to warn us.
</p>

<p>
"No child can ever know how dearly its parents
love it&mdash;how they suffer in its illness, loss or
departure," whispered Constance to herself; "still," she
thought upbraidingly, "I left my poor father to
sorrow in his humble home at Montreal&mdash;but then
it was with a husband, so dear and true!"
</p>

<p>
The child that is ill or absent, is always valued
the most; so poor Sybil was almost forgotten by
her mother for the time.  A few hours more, and
both husband and son had left her in tears, to
separate in London, each to pursue his own journey.
</p>

<p>
Of Richard's ultimate intentions, Denzil and
Sybil were to be left in ignorance, and also of the
object and purport of his absence.  So Constance
was left with her daughter only by her side.
</p>

<p>
The poor mother's heart felt as if thrust back
upon herself now, for she was the mistress of a
great family secret, which, as yet, she could not
share even with Sybil.
</p>

<p>
So the long dreaded "to-morrow," had come, and
other morrows followed, and Constance began to
feel herself most sadly alone.  Often she stole into
the well-known room to kiss the pillow on which
her Denzil's cheek had rested; to weep over the
bed as if a death had been there, and not the
departure of a gallant boy full of hope and life;
and on each occasion as she lingered there, she
strove to pourtray in fancy his face, as she last saw
him, sleeping all unconscious that she hovered
near; and with a wild but loving presentiment and
hope that he would again occupy it some day, she
kept his room intact, exactly as he had left it; his
books, his fencing foils on those particular shelves,
his old hat stuck round with fishing flies, on that
particular peg where he was wont to hang it; his
rods and guns, in yonder corner; though every
detail, such as these, reminded her of him more
vividly, fed her grief and roused the intense
longing for his presence and return to her arms again.
</p>

<p>
"India&mdash;India?" she would say half aloud when
communing with herself; "it may be ten years of
separation.  Ten years!  Oh&mdash;no, never, surely!
With my Richard's great influence as a peer of the
realm, that must never be permitted.  In ten years
what changes must inevitably happen; who may be
alive then, and who dead?  Sybil should then be
seven-and-twenty&mdash;married perhaps&mdash;and to
whom?&mdash;with children it may be&mdash;my poor innocent
Sybil!  Oh no; three years at the utmost, and
Denzil shall be again by his mamma's side!"
</p>

<p>
So the lonely Constance pondered, hoped and
lovingly spun out like a web, her desires or mental
view of the future, striving to gather happiness
therefrom; while Sybil sought in vain to cheer her
with music, to lure her out for a walk in the
willowed dell, or a drive along the coast road, in their
pretty pony phaeton.
</p>

<p>
The month was October now.  With a sullen
wail the autumnal blasts swept from the wooded
hollows of Moorwinstow to the cavernous headland
of Tintagel, cresting before their breath the
waves of the Bristol Channel.  There came gusts of
rain too, that beat dolefully on the window panes,
with an angry and impatient patter, adding to the
dreariness of heart experienced by those in the
Villa of Porthellick.  The season was bleak, and
nowhere could it seem more so than among the barren
moors, the sea-beat bluffs, and resounding caverns,
the wind swept pasture lands and promontories of
Cornwall.
</p>

<p>
The woods were almost bare; the few remaining
leaves, fluttered brown and crisp on the bared twigs;
the stackyards were full, and the produce of the
potato fields was consigned to long brown pits of
fresh earth and straw, for the coming winter; the
uplands were covered with decaying stubble, or
being ploughed, while, gorged with worms, the great
crows sat sleepily in the shining furrows.  Thick as
gnats in summer, the dingy coloured sparrows
twittered in the hedgerows, which were being lopped
and trimmed; and the axes of the woodmen were
heard in thicket and copse; while the smoke of the
steam-engine that worked and drained the adjacent
copper-mine, hung low in the frowsy air, adding
at times to the gloom of the landscape.
</p>

<p>
Richard Trevelyan had sailed, and Denzil too;
and Constance was aware that each of them had to
traverse a wintry sea, the former before he returned
and the latter before he reached his destination.
</p>

<p>
The public prints had duly announced that "the
Right Hon. Lord Lamorna and suite (<i>i.e.</i> old Derrick
Braddon) had gone for a tour in America;" and
Denzil if his eyes ever saw the announcement&mdash;which
is doubtful&mdash;could little have dreamed how
nearly it concerned him, and the mother on whom
he doted, and whom he still knew only as
"Mrs. Devereaux."
</p>

<p>
The latter had to make many an excuse, even to
Sybil, to account for her husband's protracted
absence from the villa; and Downie Trevelyan,
when he read the above announcement in the
"Morning Post," wiped his gold eye-glass and read
it again with much perplexity and secret annoyance,
while surmising "what the deuce could take
Richard so suddenly to America at this season of
the year!"
</p>

<p>
The new task and anxiety of watching the shipping
intelligence next occupied the attention of
Constance.  The steamer in which Richard sailed,
had been seen, signalled and spoken with in
sundry Atlantic latitudes and longitudes; and some
seventeen days or so saw her safely at the end of
her voyage; but the transport, a great Indiaman
with Denzil on board, was seldom heard of, some at
long dates; and at longer dates too, came his
hastily written letters from St. Helena, and from
Ascension, or by homeward-bound ships; few men,
even of the most wealthy, thought then of proceeding
to India by the scarcely developed overland
route; and how fondly those letters were read over
and over again, the last thing at night, and the first
in the morning, the mother, situated as Constance
was then, may imagine; for the loving little family
circle was broken now.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
FOREBODINGS.
</h3>

<p>
If ever Constance left the villa, she sought the
direction of the coast, and when there never wearied
of watching the wide expanse of the Bristol
Channel with its passing ships and steamers; for the
changing ocean was the path by which her loved
ones were to return to her; Richard, within a month
perhaps, now; but their son Denzil&mdash;oh, years must
elapse, her heart foreboded and knew, ere she should
see him again.
</p>

<p>
And now as the season advanced, and storms and
wrecks among the Scilly Isles and about the Land's
End were not unfrequent, her soul became a prey
to nervous fears, that were fed and fostered in spite
of herself by Derrick's sister, Winny Braddon, a
superstitious old Cornish woman, who had been
Sybil's nurse.
</p>

<p>
Winny, a devout believer in dreams, visions, the
virtues of miraculous wells and so forth, was wont
to declare that when all specifics failed she had
been cured of rheumatism by crawling through the
famous Men-an-tol, or Holed Stone near Lanyon;
and now she shook her grey head ominously when
the wind blew a gale and rolled a heavy surf upon
the shore, and averred that she could hear the
wreck-bells booming under the sea at Boscastle.
</p>

<p>
So Constance, though naturally free from all idle
fancies save that which we may term the affectionate
superstition of the heart, could not listen to the
croaking of this old woman without vague and
growing fear; for though Winny knew nothing of the
interest that "Mrs. Devereaux" had in the family
of Lamorna, or her connection therewith (Derrick
having kept his secret well) those sounds amid the
deep at Boscastle were supposed by Cornish tradition
to bode evil to the line of Trevelyan.
</p>

<p>
For it would appear, as Winny Braddon related,
that long ago the villagers of Boscastle were very
envious of the melodious and musical bells that
were rung in the church of Tintagel, to which they
were a gift from its superior the Abbot of
Fontevrault in Normandy.  So De Bottreaux who was
lord of the manor, and the site of whose castle is
now marked by a green mound only, to gratify
those villagers who were his vassals, ordered from
London a merry peal for the spire of Boscastle
church; and those bells were duly shipped on board
a vessel named the <i>Koithgath</i> caravel, for her
captain, Launcelot Trevelyan, was a younger son of
the family of Lamorna.  He had been a wild
fellow, of whose future career evil had been
predicted by a <i>Pyrdrak Br√¢z</i> (old Cornish for a
great-witch) who dwelt in the Zawn Reeth, a granite
cavern at Nans Isal, on the western side of the bay
so named&mdash;a wild and savage place surrounded by
masses of scattered rock.
</p>

<p>
So Master Launcelot ran off to sea, and served
under Drake and Hawkins in many a dark and
desperate day's work among the Spaniards in
Brazil, Madeira, and the Cape de Verde; and had
once been round the Cape of Storms as far as the
realms of that mysterious personage then known as
Prester John.
</p>

<p>
Thus in due time, steered by Paul Poindester, a
famous pilot from the Scilly Isles, the <i>Koithgath</i>,
with the bells on board, arrived in the offing and in
sight of Boscastle, with all its furzy hollows, above
which rose the castle of Bottreaux, with the
standard of its owner flying&mdash;a great banner,
bearing three toads and a griffin.
</p>

<p>
As the ship drew in shore, the bells of Tintagel
church, that towers still on a bleak, exposed, and
lofty cliff to the westward of King Arthur's castle,
rang out a taunting and a joyous peal that mingled
with the booming of the ocean as it rolled on the
bluffs below, or far up the sandy bay of Trebarreth
Strand.
</p>

<p>
Then, according to the story, Launcelot Trevelyan
swore an exulting oath as he surveyed the
stupendous scenery of his native shore, adding,
</p>

<p>
"I am here again&mdash;thank my good ship and her
canvas!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said the old pilot Poindester, as he
reverently lifted his hat, "rather thank God and
St. Michael of Cornwall."
</p>

<p>
"By Heaven," rejoined Trevelyan, "I thank
myself and the fair wind only."
</p>

<p>
Poindester though fearless, for he was a native of
those dangerous Isles where for one who dies a
natural death nine are drowned, rebuked this
irreverence, on which the wild Trevelyan stormed
and blasphemed, and forgetting to heed his compass
or steerage, permitted his caravel to be dashed
ashore, just as a sudden storm came on, and the
waves of the Bristol Channel hurled her on the
cliffs of the Black Pit, where every soul on board
perished, save old Paul Poindester.  From the high
gilded poop of his caravel, Launcelot Trevelyan,
with a fierce malediction, cast into the sea, before
it swallowed him up, the silver whistle and chain,
his badge of naval authority, the gift of Sir Francis
Drake, lest it should become some wrecker's prey;
and as the timbers parted, and the ship went down
into the angry sea, the clangour of the bells
resounded in her hold; and there to this day they
are heard by people loitering on the shore, when
storms are nigh&mdash;or when aught is about to happen
to the family of Lamorna, add the superstitious
folks of Cornwall.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why did this absurd old woman relate such
a boding story to me?" thought Constance, for
situated as she was, she had become somewhat of a
prey to gloomy and grotesque fancies; hence, often
in the night she would dream of wrecks, and seem
to hear the sound of alarm-bells in her ear, and
starting from bed, would draw up the window-blind
and look forth to see if a storm was raving without,
forgetting then, even though it were so, all might be
calm and peaceful elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Then when she saw the autumnal moon in all its
unclouded glory flooding her chamber and her white
night-dress with silver lustre; that all was calm and
still, the diamond-like stars sparkling above the
dark willows in the glen, or the darker woodland
in the distance; and that no noises came to her
listening ear, but perhaps the bark of a house-dog,
or such as may be aptly termed the sounds of night
and silence, she would go back to her lonely pillow
with a prayer on her lips for those who were absent,
and for all who were on the sea.
</p>

<p>
A letter from Richard, made her supremely happy!
</p>

<p>
He had reached Montreal in safety.  The poor
old cur√© of the secluded little chapel of St. Mary&mdash;the
good P√®re Latour&mdash;was dead, and had been so
for some time; hence the reason that her husband's
letters had remained unanswered.  Even the little
acolyte, the other witness of their marriage, had
gone to his last home; and now in memory,
Constance could recall the thin, spare figure of the
old clergyman, with his white hair brushed behind
his ears, his peculiar shovel hat, long black soutane,
cape and gaiters to the knee&mdash;for he had been a
man of the old school of French colonial priests.
</p>

<p>
"His little chapel and vestry, both built of wood,
as you will remember, Conny, were burned down
three years after our regiment left the city,"
continued Richard's letter; "and all the Records
there perished in the flames; among other things,
the volume of the Register in which our marriage
was entered.  But, most providentially, the
successor of Latour in the poor incumbency, found
among some of his papers, the signed copy&mdash;or
rather I should say, the original of our marriage
lines or certificate&mdash;which we had never received.
<i>It is now in my possession</i>, and I have folded it
inside a will which I prepared on the voyage out&mdash;a
will, dearest Conny, in which, to make all certain
for the future&mdash;as there are those at home, whom
I doubt&mdash;I leave all I have in the world to you
for life, and to Denzil and Sybil after you,
absolutely.  Your poor father and mother are
interred not far from the grave of P√®re Latour,
and I have ordered white marble crosses to be
erected to the memory of the three.  I shall sail
for England a fortnight hence, in the steamer
<i>Admiral</i>, and till then, shall renew in sweet
fancy the days of our loverhood, by many a ramble
about Montreal; by Hochlega, the picturesque site
of the old Indian village, now its eastern suburb;
the nine aisles of the great Cathedral; the gardens
of the Convent of Notre Dame, and among the
mountains close by&mdash;in many a shady walk and
lane; and Heaven and myself alone can know how
I miss you and our dearest Sybil, and how I am
longing to return."  It was signed "<i>Lamorna</i>."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, dear Richard!" sobbed the wife, while
her tears of joy fell fast.
</p>

<p>
"All the places I mention, you must remember
well," he added in a postscript; "and you may
imagine how sad it is for me to wander alone where
once we were so happy together."
</p>

<p>
"He was to sail in a fortnight from the date of
his letter," thought Constance, with a glow of
pleasure in her heart; "he must now be on the sea! and
in a fortnight from this, I shall see him again&mdash;my
dear, dear husband&mdash;so kind, so good, so true
and thoughtful, even to mark, unasked by me, the
last resting-place of poor mamma and papa&mdash;and
even of the good P√®re Latour.  The latter act, is in
itself, a compliment to me."
</p>

<p>
Then an emotion of terror seized her, as she
perused the letter again.
</p>

<p>
What if the attested copy of those important
"lines," their certificate of marriage, <i>had perished</i>
in the same fire which consumed the wooden chapel,
the vestry, and its registers!  What then would
have been her fate, and more than all, by sequence,
the fate and position of the children she idolised&mdash;her
proud boy Denzil, and the beautiful Sybil, now
budding on the verge of womanhood?
</p>

<p>
A stigma&mdash;a stain&mdash;she could never remove,
might have been on them, to the end of their
lives; and her soul seemed to die within her as
she thought of the peril&mdash;the narrow escape, they
had all made!
</p>

<p>
She thanked Heaven with fervour in her heart,
and again and again, it swelled with gratitude to her
husband, and with love for him and confidence in
him; with joy, too, that he would so soon hear all
this from her own loving lips&mdash;for in a few days
now, the <i>Admiral</i> would be due in the Thames!
</p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE LONELY TARN.
</h3>

<p>
While Constance Trevelyan&mdash;or Lady Lamorna,
for so we ought to name her, though still known
only as Mrs. Devereaux&mdash;was counting the hours
of her husband's absence, and looking forward
fondly to his return, Sybil, unnoticed, was absent
from home more often and for longer periods than
had been her wont; and the mother, preoccupied
by her own secret thoughts, and anxiety for those
who were far distant, failed to remark the circumstance
till it was incidentally mentioned by Winny Braddon.
</p>

<p>
When questioned, Constance remarked with
concern, that Sybil blushed deeply, and hastened to
show her sketch-book, now nearly full, as an
evidence of her artistic industry, and the progress
she had made; she did not add with whom, or
that she had a lover.  She who never before had
a secret from her mamma, was beginning to have
one now; and had the latter looked more closely at
the sketch-book, she might have found traces and
touches of a bolder and more masterly pencil than
Sybil's; and it all came to pass thus.
</p>

<p>
A mile or two from the Villa of Porthellick, there
lies a lake, which had been a favourite resort of her
brother Denzil when fishing for pike; and of this
place, and a great old Druidical stone that stands
thereby, Sybil wished to make a sketch, and on a
suitable day proceeded thither with all her
apparatus, as she was anxious to have her production
finished before her papa's return.
</p>

<p>
It was a lonely tarn, deep and dark, yet there the
bright green leaves and snowy flowers of the water
lilies floated, and the voracious pike which rose at
times to snap a fly or so, went plunging to the oozy
bottom at the sight of aught so unusual as a human
being invading the solitude.
</p>

<p>
There were within its circuit, three tiny
willow-tufted isles, where the water-ducks built their
nests amid the osiers, and near which an occasional
wild swan flapped defiance with its wings
among the floating lilies that impeded its stately
progress.
</p>

<p>
On the hill slopes the varied tints of autumn
were in all their beauty; the ripened apples and
pears were dropping among the long grass of many
an orchard; green yet lingered amid the foliage of
the old Cornish elms; but the beeches were almost
blood red, and the oaks were crisped and brown.
In the calm depth of the tarn was reflected the
shadow of the giant stone pillar, around which the
storms, the winds and rain of perhaps three
thousand years had swept; yet there it stood, solid,
silent, grim and monstrous.  Could that stone have
spoken, what a tale it might have told of savage
rites and human sacrifice; what a history unfolded
of races long since passed away or merged in
others&mdash;the men of days before even the galleys of the
Phoenicians cast anchor in Bude Bay, when their
crews came to barter for tin with the wild
aborigines of Cornwall.
</p>

<p>
Sybil, seated on a little camp-stool, was so intent
upon her work, that some time elapsed before she
perceived that another artist&mdash;whether professional
or, like herself an amateur, she could not
determine&mdash;was similarly occupied not far from her; and
insensibly her eye wandered, from time to time, in
the direction of this stranger.
</p>

<p>
He was decidedly a handsome young man, whose
grey tweed suit and round hat of grey felt,
encircled by a narrow crape band, failed to conceal
a very distinguished air.  His features were good
and well bronzed by a foreign sun, apparently.  He
was without whiskers, or was closely shaven; but
a smart mustache and dark eyebrows gave character
to his face.  He was seated on a fragment
of rock, and in intervals between the progress of
his work and the whiffs of a cigar, spoke caressingly
to a large dog that lay near him on the
grass.
</p>

<p>
The latter, a magnificent Thibet mastiff, with
heavy jowl and pendant flap-like ears, suddenly
rose and came slowly, leisurely and steadily forward
to Sybil, and after a glance of survey, eyed her with
what was almost a smile&mdash;if a <i>dog</i> can be said to
smile.  He then sniffed her skirts, and pawed them
with his enormous paw.  Sybil evinced no fear; she
patted the clog's huge rough head; but was
somewhat surprised, when he lay down on her skirts
with the utmost composure, and showed no
disposition to release her.
</p>

<p>
The young man, whose eyes had followed, with
some interest, the motions of his dog, now whistled
to him; but the mastiff did not stir.
</p>

<p>
"Rajah&mdash;Rajah&mdash;you impudent rascal, come
here!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
But Rajah made no other response, than by
whipping the turf with his long tail.
</p>

<p>
Upon this his master came round the margin of
the tarn, and approaching Sybil, threw aside his
cigar, lifted his hat and apologized, adding,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I trust that my dog has not alarmed you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no&mdash;not in the least," replied Sybil, who
began to feel somewhat embarrassed now.
</p>

<p>
"I assure you that he is very gentle; but he is
permitting himself to be too free, and very few
young ladies would, like you, have seen such an
animal approach them without betraying signs of
alarm, and all that sort of thing.  Get up sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please don't," said Sybil holding out an
ungloved and very pretty hand, deprecatingly,
between the dog and the young man's uplifted
cane; "all dogs, and even cats, like me."
</p>

<p>
"Thereby acknowledging your power&mdash;eh?"
responded the stranger, looking down admiringly
into the soft, bright, earnest face, and clear dark
eyes that were turned upward to his own.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean by my power,"
said Sybil, with simplicity; "but, as most people
like me, why should not dogs&mdash;and&mdash;and this is
such a splendid fellow!'
</p>

<p>
"I have brought him from a very distant country&mdash;he
was the farewell gift of a friend who died,
otherwise," he added, gallantly, "I should beg your
acceptance of him."
</p>

<p>
Sybil now coloured more deeply, and became
uneasy; but the stranger resumed in his most
suave tone,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And you have been sketching this pretty little
lake&mdash;like me?  Our tastes and occupation are
quite similar!"
</p>

<p>
Sybil had closed her book of sketches.
</p>

<p>
"Will you not do me the favour to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Show you my poor production&mdash;do you mean, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But you may be an artist, and a well-skilled one."
</p>

<p>
"And what then?"
</p>

<p>
"I should blush for my work."
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  Well, then, I am not an artist, but merely
an amateur&mdash;an officer on leave; yet I am fond of
using my pencil, and have the regimental reputation
of doing so with pretty good success."
</p>

<p>
Sybil thought of her brother Denzil&mdash;he too was
an officer; poor Denzil, now so far, far away&mdash;and
she gave her new acquaintance a half shy and half
doubtful glance, that served to charm him very
much, and then showed her sketch, which he
praised warmly, as by good breeding and in duty
bound.
</p>

<p>
It was doubtless cleverly done, but his eye
wandered to the rare and delicate beauty of the
little hand that had achieved it.  Her sketch,
however, was inferior to his own, which he now
produced, with Sybil's own figure seated on the
camp-stool introduced in the middle distance, so
as to give the exact proportion of the great
rock-pillar.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir," she exclaimed, "you have me in your
sketch, as well as the big stone."
</p>

<p>
"Could I omit the most pleasing feature in my
little landscape?"
</p>

<p>
Sybil coloured again, for her education, and the
peculiar mode in which she had been reared, made
her, at times, shy and reserved; she knew not why,
for to be so was not her natural character, which
was rather candid, frank, and free; so, to change
the subject from herself, she hastened to turn over
the leaves of the stranger's sketch-book, wherein
were many drawings full of spirit and interest.
</p>

<p>
"That wooden cross," said he, "marks the grave
of poor Jack Delamere, who gave me Rajah,
through whom I have had the pleasure of making
your acquaintance to-day.  He died when we were
on the march up country to Allahabad, and I
buried him in a grove of date palms."
</p>

<p>
"And he lies there alone?" said Sybil, her eyes
involuntarily wandering to the great dog which lay
near them on the grass.
</p>

<p>
"Quite alone&mdash;poor Jack! he was the soul of the
mess-bungalow."
</p>

<p>
"And what is this Hall with the wonderful
pillars?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! that is a Buddhist Temple&mdash;all hewn out
of the living rock.  I sketched it at Ellora.  Those
caves are masses of carving, and are among the most
wonderful things in India, as they often consist of
many apartments or halls of vast height, decorated,
as you see, with elaborate columns and monstrous
statues.  My next sketch is a Hindoo water-girl.  I
gave her a rupee to stand for me at Arcot; but, as
her clothing is somewhat scanty, we shall skip to
the next.  Ah&mdash;that is a mango tree, and here are
the palace of Mysore and the town and fort of
Agra."
</p>

<p>
"How much you have seen of the world!" said
Sybil, her dark eyes dilating as she glanced for a
moment at the stranger's young and handsome face;
"I wonder if Denzil will ever look upon those
places.  Heavens, how poor and mean do my Cornish
sketches of ruins, rocks, and engines look, after
yours!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, do not say so," replied the other, smiling,
as he surveyed with growing interest the soft bright
face of the speaker, under its piquant little hat and
veil; "hideous as the edifices are in reality, some
of our mining engine-houses, with all their chains
and pulleys, wheels and timber, blocks and gearing,
their heaps of rubbish and debris, they make
somewhat picturesque sketches."
</p>

<p>
"True; but I prefer those great solemn stones
of unknown antiquity, and I never tire of drawing
them."
</p>

<p>
"But they are so deucedly alike," replied the
young officer; "and now for your book&mdash;ah, do
permit me," he added, turning the leaves.
</p>

<p>
"That is the Lake of Como, where we passed
several months," said Sybil, tremulous with hesitation,
for what she deemed alike the boldness of the
attempt and the poverty of her execution.  "I now
wonder how I dared to think of depicting such a
scene, with all its white villas and green groves of
orange and flowering arbutas; its cliffs and crags,
and, over all, the snow-clad peaks of the Alps, and
the mountains of the Brianza covered with pine-forests!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps each sketch is the souvenir of some
past or tender happiness?  And this stately palace,
with the terrace before it?"
</p>

<p>
"Is one where papa and mamma resided when I
was very young."
</p>

<p>
"You are not very old yet," was the laughing
rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
"It is on the Arno.  But how often have I wished
for power to depict the lovely Lake of Como, as we
could see it by night from the windows of our villa&mdash;the
shore all dark, or dotted only by the lights in
many a palace and dwelling, the snowy summits of
the Splugen Alps rising against the starlit sky, and
the oars of the gondoliers flashing as their little
vessels shot across the sheet of silent water."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite an enthusiast!" said the officer,
smiling; and at that moment, with her sparkling
eyes and flushed cheeks, the usually pale girl looked
radiantly beautiful; but her dark eyes drooped, and
she replied&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I did so love Como and our pleasant picnics to
Bellaggio and other places, where the orange-trees
overhang the water so closely that the golden fruit
dipped in it from time to time, when the laden
branches were stirred by the passing wind."
</p>

<p>
"Now you will surely agree with me, that when
contrasted with such scenery as you describe, our
Cornish rock-pillars and mines are but stupid
affairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no&mdash;I cannot assent to that; there is Bottalick
Mine, for example, where the gloomy precipices
of slate are hewn into such fantastic shapes,
and the great engine, perched on the ledge of a
terrible cliff, enables the miner to work below the
sea.  Oh, think of that, to be quarrying for copper
and tin in damp grottoes and cells four hundred and
eighty feet below the ocean, and to hear its waves&mdash;the
same waves that dash against Cape Cornwall&mdash;rolling
the mighty boulders in thunder on the bluffs
overhead!"
</p>

<p>
"Have <i>you</i> been down and heard all that?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Sybil, blushing for her own energy
and enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"How then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Denzil has been down often."
</p>

<p>
"Denzil again," said the stranger with a smile,
and perhaps the faintest tone of pique; "you are
surely very fond of this Denzil."
</p>

<p>
"Fond&mdash;I love him dearly!"
</p>

<p>
"A candid admission."
</p>

<p>
"He is my only brother."
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad to hear that he is a brother, and
not&mdash;not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"A cousin or&mdash;friend."
</p>

<p>
Sybil felt that the conversation was wandering
from the picturesque, and now said, a little hastily,
</p>

<p>
"I must bid you good morning&mdash;my way lies
there," she added, pointing westward.
</p>

<p>
"And mine also; so far, at least, as the high
road&mdash;allow me to have the pleasure of carrying
your camp-stool."
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Do you reside in this neighbourhood?" he
asked, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;a little way from this," she replied, evasively.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> am on a visit to an old Indian friend&mdash;General
Trecarrel," said the stranger, in a tone and manner
calculated to invite confidence; but Sybil instantly
became reserved.  Her absent parent, she knew not
why, had ever most sedulously avoided the General
and all his family, and her mamma had apparently
acquiesced in this, for they knew that the General
would at once, in the spurious "Captain Devereaux,"
recognise Richard Trevelyan.  "You, perhaps, know
the Trecarrels?" added her companion.
</p>

<p>
"I have not the pleasure&mdash;though I have heard
of them, of course," replied Sybil, adjusting her veil
tightly over her face, with an air of annoyance.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman said no more; but in silence
carried her sketch-book and camp-stool until they
reached the high road, where, aware that to remain
longer with her might appear intrusive, he lifted his
hat, and with studious politeness bade her adieu.
</p>

<p>
Sybil hastened homeward, nor dared to look back,
though perfectly conscious that the eyes of the
stranger, whose voice seemed to linger in her ear,
would be looking after her more than once.  She
had all a young girl's perfect conviction of this.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
CONCERNING FLIRTATION.
</h3>

<p>
The next noon proved a lovely autumnal one, and
Sybil repaired once more to the tarn for the purpose
of giving a few finishing touches to her sketch.
She would have blushed with annoyance, and
indignantly repudiated the idea that a chance of the
stranger being there, perhaps, for the same purpose,
led her to go at precisely the same hour as on the
preceding day.  And yet, though a disappointment,
it was somewhat of a relief to her, that neither he
nor his great dog were in sight; the floating swans
and the huge rock-pillar alone met her eye in the
solitude; and seating herself, she spread out her
skirts, threw up her veil, and assumed her pencil;
but in the midst of her work, her tiny white hand
grew tremulous, every pulse quickened, and a thrill
passed through her when she heard steps among the
long rank grass; the great nose of the Thibet mastiff
was placed upon her knee, and she perceived her
new friend again approaching, but on horseback.
</p>

<p>
<i>He</i> had not made even the pretence of coming to
sketch as on the preceding morning; he was without
the materials for doing so, and hence must have
come deliberately in search of her, for he dismounted.
</p>

<p>
"I am indeed fortunate in meeting you here
again," said he, "but I shall not intrude, as I fear I
did yesterday; I am merely rambling towards the
sea-shore, to enjoy the breeze and a cigar till some
friends join me."
</p>

<p>
Sybil, who felt that she was painfully pale, bowed
to her new acquaintance, who manifested no haste
to prosecute his "ramble," but seemed perfectly
confident and disposed to be politely familiar.  Still
Sybil had no emotion of alarm at this; she had
never in her life been insulted, and felt that there
was no real cause to repulse him, save that he was a
visitor of the Trecarrels.
</p>

<p>
He, on the other hand, while gazing from time to
time into her upturned face, was struck more by the
calm, honest, and innocent expression of her radiant
features than by their beauty, which was less that
of form than of character, for though small and
exquisitely feminine, her face, like that of her
mother, was strongly marked, by the darkness of
her eyes, their brows and long lashes.  Her mouth
certainly was beautifully formed, with a soft smile
ever playing about it, for she was naturally of an
arch and highly impressionable nature.
</p>

<p>
He did not permit the conversation to flag, but
hovered near her, venturing to look over her shoulder
from time to time, and giving little suggestions
concerning her drawing, while in reality he was
admiring the ladylike contour of her head, the
delicacy of her slender neck, and the gloss of a
single thick dark ringlet that strayed so captivatingly
behind.
</p>

<p>
The first flush of emotion passed away in Sybil's
breast, and insensibly she found herself lured into
an easy interchange of opinion on various subjects;
for in the topics of foreign travel, the galleries,
habits, tastes, and amusements of other lands, they
had ample matter for conversation, and found themselves
sliding into the position of friends, and talking
of things and themes that seldom occupy the
thoughts of a young girl.
</p>

<p>
Now, as each knew not the name of the other,
and could not ask it, there was a decided awkwardness
in this; and as they continued to talk with
animation, the huge Thibet mastiff, who had been
their <i>introducteur</i>, rolled his great dark eyes from
one to the other, and lashed the grass with his tail,
as if quite satisfied with the result.
</p>

<p>
"After the colourless Indo-Britons and yellow
Bengallees, how lovely seems the complexion of this
fresh young English girl!" was the ever-recurring
thought of the young officer, as he surveyed her
critically, from her smart hat and feather to her foot
that peeped from under her dress; and a lovely
little foot it was&mdash;tiny enough to have entered the
famous slipper of Cinderella.
</p>

<p>
That the solitary girl was a lady was evident to
him; her carriage and bearing were full of graceful
ease, and she had an attraction of manner and
gesture peculiarly her own; but <i>who</i> was she, that
she, at her early years, had seen so much of the
world, and could speak of Spain and Rome, of
Athens and Sicily, and seemed to know every second
village among the wilds of the Apennines and the
Abruzzi?
</p>

<p>
The sketching of this day was somewhat protracted,
and Sybil became aware that their eyes
sought each other with an interest she had never
felt before in those of a stranger, and that each time
they so met, her pulses quickened and her cheek
flushed or grew pale.  Whence was this emotion? she
whispered in her heart.
</p>

<p>
"I shall often think of this moorland tarn, when I
am far away," said the officer.
</p>

<p>
"You leave this soon, then?" she remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I am, ere long, going back to India."
</p>

<p>
"My brother Denzil has gone there to join his
regiment."
</p>

<p>
Had the stranger asked the almost inevitable
military question, "What regiment?" a little
discovery might have been made; but he was full of
the girl's beauty, and thought of that only.  Something
of admiration or of ardour in his eyes inspired
her with confusion, and abruptly closing her book
as on the preceding day, she rose from the bank on
which she had been seated, and said, with a little
trepidation,
</p>

<p>
"I am going now, and&mdash;and here our sketching
and meetings must end."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! why?"
</p>

<p>
"I fear," she stammered as she spoke, aware that
her speech was full of awkwardness&mdash;"I fear that I
have done wrong in&mdash;in&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"Engaging in quite a flirtation with a total
stranger."
</p>

<p>
"You cannot flirt&mdash;you are too sensible and
artless; neither could I&mdash;with you, at least."
</p>

<p>
"Have you never flirted?" asked Sybil, laughing
to cover what she felt to be a second mistake.
</p>

<p>
"Often."
</p>

<p>
"Then why not with me?" she asked na√Øvely and
archly.
</p>

<p>
"First, tell me what is flirtation?"
</p>

<p>
"I know what it is; but cannot define or describe
it."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I make the attempt?"
</p>

<p>
"Do, please," said Sybil, now laughing outright.
</p>

<p>
"It is neither coquetry nor exactly playing at
courtship.  It is one of those things most difficult
indeed of description and of definition.  It depends
so much upon the time and place, the tone and
tenor of those who attempt it, and on the mood of
the moment, whether it be sad or gay.  It is perilous
work among the young and beautiful, as it is often
so much mere nonsense, and yet is so much more
dangerous to one's peace of mind than any nonsense
could ever be.  It is not so earnest or solemn as
deliberate love-making, and yet it is not quite a
mockery of it.  It is a sharp weapon in the hands
of the wary; but a dangerous pastime for those who
have had no experience in <i>affaires du coeur</i>.  It is a
kind of lovemaking that commits one to no promise,
and yet may raise the proudest and wildest anticipations
in the breast, and elicit the most unwary confidence.
Thus it is difficult to find where flirtation
exactly begins, and still more to say where it may
end&mdash;perhaps in real love and marriage.  I fear I
have read you quite a dissertation on the subject, a
most hazardous one while looking into your bright
eyes; and now tell me," added the officer, his tone
and manner becoming more soft and earnest, "have
you not done injustice to yourself and to me, for in
all we have talked over so pleasantly both yesterday
and to-day has anything of this vague kind been
attempted?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly not," replied Sybil, laughing
again.
</p>

<p>
"With you it would indeed be perilous for me,"
said the officer, taking her hand caressingly between
his own; "for I could not feign, where I would
rather feel."
</p>

<p>
His eyes were dark and deep, their colour a kind
of blue, difficult to define, but unfathomable in
expression, though very soft just then; and now Sybil
grew pale, for if the speaker was not flirting, he had
suddenly slid into downright love-making; so she
said, with an effort&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We have been here more than an hour; am I
not detaining you from your friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," said he, with an air of pique; "pardon
me for looking at my watch.  Two o'clock, by Jove! and
I promised to meet the Trecarrel girls on the
Camelford road half-an-hour ago.  I shall catch it
from little Rose for this!  And now good morning&mdash;pardon
me again if I have seemed intrusive, but I
do not despair of our meeting again."
</p>

<p>
He had mounted while speaking, and, lifting his
hat with studious politeness, cantered off, while
Rajah went bounding and barking before him.
</p>

<p>
"What a bright little fairy it is&mdash;and so clever
with her pencil! who the deuce can she be?" he was
thinking, while Sybil, with a vague sense of
disappointment and doubt, looked after him, half
fearing that she had been too pointed in her hint
that he should leave her; and yet how were they to
continue such meetings as strangers.
</p>

<p>
In her lonely life, at least latterly, since they had
settled at Porthellick, she had met but few persons,
and with none so pleasing as this young officer.
</p>

<p>
She hoped to meet him again on a more recognisable
footing, for she felt that though stolen interviews
might be very sweet, they could not be
without some peril; and to the young girl's mind,
it seemed that the formation of the acquaintance&mdash;the
whole adventure&mdash;was quite like some of the
episodes to be read of in novels; for a box from
"Mudie's," came regularly to Porthellick Villa, and
perhaps, by the laws of such literature, her strange
friend might prove a peer of the realm&mdash;a prince
it might be, incog.; who could say?
</p>

<p>
Sybil lingered long by the lonely tarn, watching
the white swans floating among the broad-leaved
water-lilies, thinking over all the stranger had said,
recalling the pleasantly modulated tones of his voice
and the expression of his dark blue eyes (if blue
they were), till the sound of hoofs on the distant
highway drew her attention in that direction, and
with something perhaps of jealousy and pique, she
saw him gallop past with two ladies, both well
mounted on bright bay horses.  They were the
Trecarrels, dashing and handsome girls, and the
sound of their merry voices and ringing laughter
came clearly over the moor as they rode at a
scamper towards Lanteglos, on the roof of the old
parish church of which the arms of the Trelawneys
and Trecarrels have been carved for centuries.
</p>

<p>
"And these girls have him with them always,"
thought she, as she turned homeward.  "What
matter is it to me&mdash;the acquaintance of a couple
of days? why should the idea of him affect me so?"
</p>

<p>
After this day she sought the vicinity of the
rock-pillar and the tarn no more.
</p>

<p>
She was too open and candid in all her actions,
and loved her mamma too well to conceal ultimately
from her the pleasant interviews she had by the
moorland tarn "with such a delightful young man;"
but there her confidence ended; she did not give
the additional information that on three successive
Sundays, when mamma was too ill to attend church,
he had lingered or walked by the side of her
basket-phaeton, to the manifest annoyance of the
Misses Trecarrel, or that she had faintly promised,
<i>some</i> day, to make with him a joint sketch of
certain rocks upon the sea-shore; still less did she
whisper, that in her secret heart she liked him well,
or trusted to time or chance for the establishment
of an interchange of thought as yet concealed, "as
though the bridge between them was yet too frail
to cross;" and Constance, occupied solely by solicitude
concerning the now-protracted absence of her
husband, did not at first make any inquiries.
</p>

<p>
Sybil found the stranger's image, his tones and
words recurring perpetually to her mind in spite
of herself, and she blushed at the conviction.  She
had few male friends&mdash;beyond the burly rector and
old village doctor, perhaps none&mdash;and certainly none
that she had met elsewhere proved so graceful and
winning as this unknown admirer.  To her partial
eyes, he seemed the beau-ideal of manly beauty,
while to those of others&mdash;even the Trecarrel
girls&mdash;he was simply a passably handsome fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Why do I think of him at all?" she would ask
of herself: "though so young, he may be married&mdash;or
engaged&mdash;engaged perhaps to that Rose Trecarrel
of whom he seemed so much afraid the other day.
Yet he may surmise the same of me&mdash;I, Sybil
Devereaux, married!" and then she laughed at
her own conceit.
</p>

<p>
"There is a depth in the human heart which,
once stirred, is long, long, ere its waters again
subside," and this depth he had contrived to stir
in the heart of Sybil.  She who had seemed as
bright as the day, and happy as the blackbird that
sang on the adjacent rose-trees, became silent and
thoughtful and apt to indulge in dreamy moods.
</p>

<p>
Old Winny Braddon was the first to detect this;
and so she set herself to watch, and hence the hints
she gave to Constance&mdash;hints which caused the
production of the sketch-book, with some confusion on
Sybil's part, as recorded in our tenth chapter, and
she took her young favourite to task in the usual
mode of old nurses, by commenting upon the
enormity of thinking of love or marriage at her
years.
</p>

<p>
Now Sybil, like every young girl of her age, had
her day-dreams of a lover, just such a lover as this,
but she had not, as yet, thought of marriage.  Such
a catastrophe&mdash;such a separation from "dearest
mamma"&mdash;had not quite entered her mind; but
now, by Winny Braddon's remarks, it seemed to be
thrust upon her consideration.  She blushed and
felt abashed, as if the modesty of her nature had
been assailed, and her girlish mind was filled with
a vague sense of dread and awe, she knew not of
what or of whom.
</p>

<p>
However, it chanced that on the last day he had
lingered by the side of her pony-phaeton for a few
minutes, resting his arms on the side thereof in
such a way that she could not, without positive
rudeness, have driven off, she had been resolving,
but not without a struggle in her heart, that she
would place herself in his way no more.
</p>

<p>
"This must end," had been her thought; "it is
most unfair to poor mamma, and is unwise for my
own peace of mind;" and it was while she thus
determined, he came to her smiling, and leaning on
the side of the little phaeton, when the Trecarrels
were conversing with the rector's family, said in his
pleasant voice,
</p>

<p>
"Shall we ever resume the little discussion we
had so merrily on that delightful day beside the old
rock-pillar?"
</p>

<p>
"Discussion&mdash;on what?" asked Sybil, timidly.
</p>

<p>
"Flirtation&mdash;Miss Devereaux."
</p>

<p>
"What! you know my name?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I am happy to say I do now, Sybil Devereaux."
</p>

<p>
"How came this to pass?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply enough: the Trecarrel girls told me."
</p>

<p>
"But I do not know them," said Sybil, with a
tone of pique.
</p>

<p>
"May I have the pleasure of introducing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, please, but not just now," said she,
hastily, remembering how her father had ever
avoided the family of the General.
</p>

<p>
"And now I must tell you my name&mdash;Audley
Trevelyan, late of the 14th Hussars."
</p>

<p>
"I have surely heard it before," said Sybil,
pondering, "but where I know not now."
</p>

<p>
It was in the <i>Gazette</i> together with that of Denzil,
but she had forgotten the circumstance, and he said,
smiling still,
</p>

<p>
"You may easily have heard it&mdash;the name is
peculiar to Cornwall, and my uncle is Lord
Lamorna."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed! all Cornwall has heard that the late
lord was a very, very proud man.
</p>

<p>
"Absurdly so; but I must bid you adieu.  Rose
Trecarrel is impatient."
</p>

<p>
"We are going, Mr. Trevelyan," said that young
lady, with some asperity of tone, from the window
of the carriage in which she and her sister were
seated; and lifting his hat, Audley hastened to join
them.  The footman threw up the carriage-steps,
fussily closed the door, and they departed.  So, as
doubtless the reader has foreseen, Sybil's admirer
was her own cousin; yet neither knew of the
relationship.
</p>

<p>
She drove off in a somewhat dubious state of
mind, amid which, as she permitted the reins to
drop listlessly on the backs of her two little ponies
and allowed them to go at their own pace, she
gave way to the current of thought, and ended in a
quiet shower of tears, which, however, calmed and
soothed her.  She had an undefined emotion of
pique alike at this stranger, Mr. Trevelyan, and
Rose Trecarrel; and as she had been learning to
love the former, she resented his extreme intimacy
with the latter, and she knew all the perils of
propinquity with a girl so lovely as Rose undoubtedly
was.
</p>

<p>
Hence, more than ever did she resolve to avoid
him, and even sought to nurse herself into emotions
of anger by fancying there was something that
savoured of forwardness in the mode in which he
had recently addressed her.  The moment she
reached home and tossed the reins to the groom,
she hastened to the side of Constance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mamma," she exclaimed, in a tumult of
excitement, "I have discovered the name of the
gentleman about whom you spoke to me lately!"
</p>

<p>
"The hero of the sketch-book, and it is&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Audley Trevelyan; don't you think it so
pretty?"
</p>

<p>
Constance was silent for nearly a minute.  Then
foreseeing much trouble and danger if this intimacy
were permitted to ripen before her husband's return,
and the full recognition of herself, her son and
daughter, in their proper place, and in society in
general&mdash;society, "that Star Chamber of the
well-bred world,"&mdash;she said, with grave energy, while
taking Sybil's flushed face between her soft white
hands,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Promise to me, darling, that you will meet him
no more&mdash;at least until advised by your papa."
</p>

<p>
"I give you my promise, dearest mamma."
</p>

<p>
"Remember that he is the friend, the guest, of
those Trecarrels whom your papa has ever avoided
for reasons best known to himself, though they
seem people of the best style; and you owe this
obedience to him in his absence."
</p>

<p>
"Have no fear for me, mamma; I shall ever
obey you," replied Sybil, as she threw her arms
round her mother's neck and kissed her to conceal
the tears that were welling up in her fine dark
eyes.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE PIXIES' HOLE.
</h3>

<p>
On the following evening Sybil had set forth on
an errand of charity to one of the many poor who
blessed the bounteous hand of her mother&mdash;the
widow of a fisherman who had perished during the
pilchard season in the past summer&mdash;and she meant
to return, as she stated, by the sea-shore.
</p>

<p>
Sybil had much cause for thought, and was
somewhat disposed to linger on the way.  The ample
means enjoyed by her parents on the one hand, with
the general seclusion of their lives on the other, and
their studied avoidance of society when in England,
had now given the girl much reason for reflection.
</p>

<p>
Her papa's mysterious absence too, and her
mamma's nervous anxiety about American letters,
were not without singularity; and why had both so
sedulously abstained from all introduction to the
family of the Trecarrels, who were greatly esteemed
in the neighbourhood, and who were undoubtedly
people of the best style?  By the system of which
this seemed merely a portion, she was even now
debarred from having properly presented to her this
Mr. Audley Trevelyan, who seemed so well disposed
to admire&mdash;perhaps, to love her.
</p>

<p>
"We have made but few acquaintances and, of
course, still fewer friends at Porthellick," said Sybil,
half aloud; "now why is it thus&mdash;to have means in
plenty and so few to love us?  What can be the
reason?  Mamma has some <i>secret</i>; but what can
that secret be?  Poor mamma&mdash;she looks so sweet
always, and yet so sad at times!"
</p>

<p>
She would write to Denzil, she thought, on the
subject of these mysteries; but Denzil was yet at
sea, and it would be long, long, before she might
receive his answer; and, then, there would be an
awkwardness in their parents' reading, as they
would certainly wish to do, his letters and
perceiving the doubts she had suggested&mdash;the secrets
she wished to probe.  Perhaps when her papa,
whose especial pet she wras, returned, she might
venture to give some hints, to make some inquiries;
and as she saw the white sails of the shipping and
the smoke of many a passing steamer, she lifted her
eyes to heaven with an unuttered prayer in her
heart, that she might soon again hear his voice and
cast herself into his arms.
</p>

<p>
By one of those lanes peculiar to Cornwall, where
the old road is sunk so deep in the ground and the
bordering walls are so high that the surrounding
scenery is sometimes hidden, lanes where in summer
the elms cast their leafy shadows, and the fragrant
wild rose and honeysuckle mingle with the long
tangles of the bramble, Sybil reached the shore and
descended to the very margin of the sea.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those evenings which, even in the
last days of autumn, come to the rocky and rugged
duchy, when the atmosphere is so mild and balmy
that one might think it was in the early weeks of
spring, when the grey cliffs and purple moorland
glisten in the yellow rays as the sunlight falls softly
between the flying clouds, on land and sea; and the
sparkling stream, that rolls from rock to rock on its
passage to the shore, makes music in its plash as it
falls from the cascade into the pool below, where the
brown trout lurks in safety and unseen; and Sybil,
as she wandered on, felt, she knew not why, an
emotion of calm and contentment growing in her
heart.
</p>

<p>
But in its serenity and beauty the evening was
deceptive, and old fishermen on the heights, and
other weather-beaten salts who lingered, telescope
in hand, on many a rude pier that jutted into the
Bristol Channel, when looking seaward detected
that which the landsman saw not&mdash;the tokens of a
coming storm; for seamen have strange instincts
peculiarly their own, and can read the sky like the
pages of a mighty book.
</p>

<p>
Across the sea the sun, now setting, poured a
steady stream of golden radiance, like a broad and
glittering pathway from the far horizon to the very
shore, by the margin of which Sybil was now lingering;
and it tinted with warm light the flinty brow of
many a storm-beaten headland, and those fantastic
piles of grey granite which cap the hills in Cornwall,
and are there called <i>carns</i>.
</p>

<p>
Seated on a fragment of rock, lulled by the
regular and monotonous rolling of the surge, Sybil
was immersed in thoughts of her absent father and
brother, each now traversing the same sea, and yet
so far apart upon its waters; she thought of Audley
Trevelyan.  Should she ever meet him in society
as she wished to do?  A little time and it might be
too late, for Rose Trecarrel was so lovely, and
already seemed to consider him as her own
property; for it was by her side he sat in church,
where they used the same books, and it was she that
he usually shawled or cloaked first for the carriage;
so if they were not already engaged, they might very
soon be so.
</p>

<p>
Amid this reverie she was startled by a distant
voice holloing, and apparently to her.  She looked
up, and on the summit of a cliff that overhung the
shore, some two hundred feet or so above where she
was seated, a man was gesticulating violently and
beckoning to her.
</p>

<p>
Was he mad or tipsy? was her mamma ill; or
what did this person mean?  She listened intently
and thought she heard her own name; he was
evidently addressing her, and pointing to the sea.
At last his voice distinctly reached her ear.
</p>

<p>
"Look out, Miss Devereaux,&mdash;the tide is coming in!"
</p>

<p>
She glanced hastily round her, and a chill struck
upon her heart, for the fragment of granite on which
she sat was almost environed by the encroaching
sea, and the stripe of yellow sand, by which she had
been walking at the base of the cliffs, was nearly
covered by the surf, which was already chafing
white and angrily about the rocky headlands which
formed the horns of a little bay.
</p>

<p>
Heedless of wetting her feet, Sybil gathered her
skirts in her hand and rushed shoreward, when a
greater terror smote her heart as she looked around
her.  The man on the cliff had disappeared; no aid
seemed nigh, and no living thing was visible save a
solitary chough or red-legged crow, which was
perched on a fragment of rock, from whence he eyed
her in quiet security.
</p>

<p>
She was at a part of the coast where the land
receded and the sea advanced between two headlands
of granite, precipitous and sheer, but crowned by
groves of ancient trees.  The water, as yet, was
smooth as a mill-pond within the bay, and reflected
in its glassy depths the coast that towered above it;
while no sound came along the vast expanse of
shore, save the hollow gurgle of the flowing tide, as
it sought the recesses of the many caverns and
fissures in the lower rocks.  In the offing, however,
the rising waves were edged with white, and this
sign, together with the lowering sky and gathering
clouds, showed that the coming night would be a
rough one.
</p>

<p>
From the stripe of sandy beach, now nearly
covered by the incoming sea, the only path lay
round a little moss-grown slope at the base of an
enormous rock, from whence it wound upward to
the verge of a steep precipice and led to the deep
old lane, already described.  Over this mossy and
angular ledge the angry tide had already rolled its
spray, consequently it was too slippery for the
footsteps of the affrighted girl, who, after thrice
approaching it, finally shrunk back, and ran, with
wetted feet, towards the centre of the bay, keeping
close to the sheer cliffs, against which the flowing
sea was rising fast, and beginning to surge and
boom, throwing masses of foam and froth over her
whole person, while the scared seagulls and puffins
whirled in flights around her.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice a wild shriek escaped Sybil; then
her voice began to fail her, and she could only utter
prayers that were earnest, deep, and piteous.
</p>

<p>
Wildly and despairingly she looked upward to the
summits of the cliffs; they were impending and
inaccessible, by their gloomy outline fully illustrating
the influence and fury of what is called "the
Atlantic drift," which is especially turned into the
Bristol Channel, where the rocks, by the waves for
ever heaving and rolling in mighty undulations, are
worn into concave fronts, and form thus a hopeless
barrier to the shipwrecked, and to all who might
seek to ascend them.
</p>

<p>
She turned seaward with haggard eyes and wrung
her poor little hands; not a boat was near, and
nothing now was visible between the horns of the
bay save the smoke of some distant steamer,
hull-down below the horizon line, as she sped on her
way to the coast of Ireland.  The flowing tide was
above Sybil's ankles now; she knew that at high
water it would mount to several feet, and that ere
long her drowned corse should be dashed and battered,
at the sport of the waves, against those very
rocks at which she glanced so despairingly!
</p>

<p>
The man who had seen from their summit and
warned her&mdash;where was he now, and who was he?
He knew her name, and yet had he abandoned her
to her fate in that terrible place, with the sea and
the darkness closing fast around her; for the sun
had set and dun clouds were piled in stormy masses
now, where so lately all was golden sheen.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she bethought her of a cavern in the
rocks known as the Pixies' Hole, which her brother
Denzil had often explored&mdash;a gloomy place, the
haunt at times of the seal and of the <i>zart</i>, as old
Cornish folks called the sea-urchin.  It was one of
those great caverns in which, in the barbarous times
of old, the Cornish men took shelter from the
Romans and Saxons, just as the children of Israel
did from the Midianites in the dens of the mountains;
and there, by local superstition, still abode,
unscared by the whistle of the adjacent railway,
certain little beings known as the Pixies, who came
hither from Devonshire on dark nights, mounted on
the farmers' horses, and were heard to sing in its
recesses while pounding their cider.
</p>

<p>
Gathering her skirts again, the poor girl dashed
through the water, and ere long reaching the mouth
of the cavern, clambered in breathlessly, falling, the
while, more than once on her tender hands, when
her feet slipped, on the glassy surface of the sea-weedy
rocks and stones, which covered all the ascent
to this gaunt and gloomy place of refuge.
</p>

<p>
She knew that it penetrated far inland, and hoped
that there for a time she should be safe; but there
would be hours of darkness, cold, and captivity to
endure, ere the ebb of the tide would permit her to
escape, and by that time what must be the terror of
her poor mamma!
</p>

<p>
When fairly within this place her courage rose a
little, for she saw that it closely resembled a grotto
she had frequently visited and sketched&mdash;the Cave
of Porthmellin.  The floor of this great fissure in
the rocks ascended at an angle from the shore, mid
as the tide advanced, Sybil found herself compelled
to retire further and further still, inward and
upward amid its dreary uncertainties, while the rising
tide, now rolling into the bay with the full force of a
west wind, began to surge with a sound as of
thunder, about the mouth by which she had entered,
and that orifice seemed to lessen rapidly as the water
rose within it.
</p>

<p>
The roar of the sea woke a hundred weird echoes
amid the impenetrable gloom beyond her; while the
view outward from the point now attained by the
breathless and affrighted girl, for a time proved
strange and, to her artistic eye, full of wonderful
effects.  The walls of rock were dark, and yet so
polished by time and the seas of ages as to emit
reflected light, and to reveal little pools of crystal
water lying still and motionless in fissures and
crevices, where star-fish, shells, and hermit-crabs
had been left by the last ebb-tide.
</p>

<p>
With growing terror Sybil could perceive that by
each successive wave the mouth of her refuge grew
smaller, and it was evident that ere long it would be
covered by the sea, while she should be shut within!
</p>

<p>
A cry escaped her with this awful conviction; but
she uttered no more, for the echoes of her voice
came back to her strangely and with melancholy
variations, as if from vast distances.  If the cavern
mouth were totally submerged, should she be suffocated;
or if not, might she otherwise too surely die
of cold, and lie there till some holiday explorer, or
some boy in search of puffins' nests, found her
remains?  A cold current of air that swept past her
from within the cavern warned her that it had an
outlet somewhere; but it filled her soul with greater
terror, for she remembered to have heard Denzil,
old Derrick Braddon, and others say, that the Pixies'
Hole terminated in the shaft of an old and long
unused mine, down which she might fall and be dashed
to a very pulp, if she ventured one foot further; for
all was gloomy horror round her now; and as her
knees yielded under her, and she sank upon them
to pray, she felt the still rising tide flow over them
as it had rolled completely above the rocky arch of
the cave and submerged it!
</p>

<p>
Feeling the ground with her hands outspread, the
unhappy girl continued to creep a few yards further
in, and then she paused, for all that she knew to
the contrary, on the very verge of the fatal mine!
</p>

<p>
One little while she was full of pious resignation
to die, for she had lived an innocent and guiltless
life.  She drew from her bosom a locket and
fervently kissed it, as it contained the hair of
her parents and Denzil&mdash;all she loved on earth.
She knelt with her bowed head between her hands
to shut out the horrid booming and sucking sounds
of the sea in the lower part of the cave, and closing
her eyes, as if the more to concentrate her thoughts,
burst into passionate and vehement prayer.
</p>

<p>
Then anon the horror of death&mdash;and especially of
such a death, amid gloom and darkness, unseen,
unpitied, and unknown, would draw from her a piteous
wail, that was lost amid the bellowing of the sea, for
a storm of wind had now risen in the channel.
</p>

<p>
Of that newly-found admirer whom she had been
learning to love, Audley Trevelyan, she had totally
ceased to think; her heart was wholly occupied by
thoughts of her papa, her mamma, her brother
Denzil&mdash;all of whom she might never, never see
more!
</p>

<p>
Dread of falling headlong down the shaft of the
ancient mine, more than a thousand feet, perhaps,
made her, we have said, pause breathlessly, and lie
on the sloping floor of rock, listening to her watery
death coming nearer and nearer with a gurgling
sound, that, to her nervous and excited imagination,
seemed like the chuckle of a destroying fiend!
The dark unspeakable himself was alleged by the
peasantry to frequent the oozy recess of the
Pixies' Hole, and the bottom of the old shaft was
said, by the same veracious authorities, to be
haunted by the unquiet spirits of ancient miners,
who had perished there in the time of old.
</p>

<p>
Rapidly, yet terribly, through the mind of Sybil,
then, as she fully believed herself to be, hovering on
the verge of death, came back the eighteen years of
her past life; at Como, in the old palace by the Arno;
among the Apennines and the wild Abruzzi; Rome,
Athens, and elsewhere, all passed before her like a
rapid phantasmagoria&mdash;days and hours of happiness
and pleasure.  The faces and voices of her parents
and her brother so beloved, came vividly amid those
memories of their strange and aimless wandering in
foreign lands.  The secret of her mother&mdash;whatever
it was&mdash;she should never learn now; but gleams of
hope and the desire to live, mingled with the blackness
of her despair, for existence seemed sweet, and
she felt so young to die, when a long life should be
before her.
</p>

<p>
At Porthellick she must long since have been
missed, and her fancy pictured the agony of her
lonely and tender mother; the wild, noisy grief of
Winny Braddon, and the honest anxiety of those
who might be fruitlessly seeking for her along the
cliffs or through the bay by boats; seeking for her
alive or dead.
</p>

<p>
All their search would be vain, for the tide was
still rising, and now where she stood, not daring to
go further, the water flowed above her knees.  A
little time, a very little time more, and she should
be lying drowned, the sport of the waves within the
Pixies' Hole, or borne by them in their reflux, into
the mighty waste of sea that washes the rugged
shore of Cornwall.
</p>

<p>
A shrill cry escaped her as the water flowed to
her waist; and gaspingly she felt with her hands for a
little ledge of rock, up which she clambered, being in
her terror endued by unnatural strength; and then,
dripping and despairing, she felt a numbness come
over all her faculties, which prevented her responding
to certain strange sounds, somewhat like those
of human voices mingled with the barking of a dog,
now coming out of the inner gloom, while again a
superstitious dread, the result of Winny Braddon's
teaching, began to mingle with her more solid fears
and sufferings.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE TIDE IN!
</h3>

<p>
For a little space we shall return to the pretty
villa of Porthellick, and to the anxious life of her
who dwelt there; her thoughts ever with her absent
son and husband.  In this instance we put Denzil
before his father, for the return of Richard Lord
Lamorna, was looked for daily, but that of his son
might be the event of years to come; so Denzil's
last fond glance ere he left her, and his calm aspect
as he lay asleep and all unconscious that she
hovered near his pillow, were deeply impressed on
his poor mother's heart; and now an eternity of
waters rolled between them, for his ship, she knew,
must be ploughing the wide Indian Ocean.
</p>

<p>
To the wayfarer along the coast-road towards the
quaint village of Endellion (with its weather-beaten
church, and the ivied ruins of Rhoscarrock), that
white-walled villa with its rose covered peristyle
buried among the pale-green drooping willows from
which the locality takes its Cornish name, no better
example of peace, content and quiet could be
given.
</p>

<p>
Yet the place was fated to be one of anxiety and sorrow.
</p>

<p>
Seated at a little buhl escritoire in her
drawing-room, Constance was lingering over the last
letter from her husband, after the removal of
the tea equipage, and long after Sybil had set
out on her charitable mission to the fisherman's
widow.
</p>

<p>
"Richard is very long of returning, surely!" was
her prevailing thought, as she sat with her graceful
head resting on a white and dimpled hand, quite
unconscious that the sun had set beyond the sea,
and that the shades of evening were deepening
around her.
</p>

<p>
No upbraiding thought of that absent husband
entered the gentle heart of Constance; yet with all
that heart's gentleness, she could not but think
somewhat bitterly of the late Lord Lamorna, whose
unreasonable prejudices and pride of birth and
station, though only the result, the growth and
maturity of centuries of time, and many generations
of Trevelyans, had cost her years of anxiety, of
unmerited seclusion and wandering in foreign lands
under a name which was not that of her children's
father, and thus keeping them in ignorance of their
real family, its claims and rank&mdash;for the mystery
had been continued, even to the gazetting of Denzil,
under the name of Devereaux!
</p>

<p>
The rising wind as a sudden gust swept through
the grove of willows, roused her from these thoughts,
and she found old Winny Braddon, hard-featured
and keen-eyed, lingering near, with anxiety depicted
in her face.
</p>

<p>
"The winter is setting in early, surely," said
Constance; "we are not out of autumn yet, Winny,
and see how dark the evening has become!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>En h√¢v perkou gw√¢v</i>, my mother used to say,
old Cornish for 'in summer, remember winter,'"
replied Winny.  "A sad night it will be for the
poor fellows on board ship, ma'am, I fear."
</p>

<p>
"Do not say so, Winny!"
</p>

<p>
"The waves are rolling in fast, and breaking
white as snow upon Tintagel Head, and all along
Trebarreth Strand."
</p>

<p>
"And where is Miss Devereaux?"
</p>

<p>
"I know not, ma'am&mdash;only she has not
returned."
</p>

<p>
"And she was to come by the shore!" exclaimed
Constance, starting from her seat.
</p>

<p>
"The shore! do you mean the bit of sand that
lies near the Pixies' Hole?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"The tide has long since been in&mdash;my God! oh
mistress, our poor <i>chealveen</i> may be lost!" exclaimed
Winny, using the old endearing local word for
'child.'
</p>

<p>
Constance closed her escritoire with trembling
hands, and went, in alarm, to the windows which
faced the sea.  The sun, we have said, had long
since set, and athwart the dim and black and stormy
clouds that now hid the point of his departure, a
torrent of rain was falling aslant upon the dark and
foam-flecked sea, and would ere long be drenching
all the rocky shore.  A little time and all should
be darkness, and where was the absent Sybil?
</p>

<p>
Close-hauled, and running fast before the blast
for shelter in Portquin Bay, a large boat, the last,
perhaps, of the autumn pilchard fishers, careening
wildly over amid the foam, was seen to vanish round
a promontory.
</p>

<p>
A sudden access of terror now seized the heart of
Constance.  Instantly a mounted servant was
dispatched to the hut of the widow, and the man soon
came galloping back, with a scared visage and the
tidings that Miss Devereaux had left her more than
three hours ago, and had certainly descended to the
beach, as she had been seen to do so.  By this
time, darkness had fairly set in; rain was falling
fast upon the bleak coast, and "sowing wide the
pathless main," while a heavy gale from thence was
dashing a flood tide upon the shore, and the soul of
Constance grew sick with apprehension.
</p>

<p>
"The tide in! oh my God&mdash;in what can I have
offended Thee to be punished thus?  My Sybil&mdash;my
Sybil&mdash;is the cup of my bitterness to be filled
to overflowing!" she exclaimed, in a low voice as
she sank upon a sofa, while Winny Braddon wrung
her hands, and in the noisy grief peculiar to her
class, lamented, as already said, "the darling
<i>chealveen</i>" she had nursed in her bosom.
</p>

<p>
Constance would have gone forth in person to
search, bleak and rainy though the night; but she
was too feeble and delicate to face the storm, nor
would Nurse Braddon permit her.  She sent all her
servants, male and female, in search of the tidings
she was terrified to hear; and ever and anon she
rushed to the front portico and looked out upon
the gloomy night, to where away beyond the willow
groves that grew around the villa, the bleak high
road wound seaward over a bare Cornish moor,
towards those clumps of old trees that crowned the
rocks which overlooked the fatal Pixies' Hole.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, as if each were an eternity of time, hour
after hour passed now&mdash;periods filled up by agony
and the pulsations of her heart; and ere long her
watch told her that midnight was nigh.
</p>

<p>
Midnight, and her child still absent&mdash;her Sybil,
the mistress of a thousand pretty, winning and
affectionate ways!
</p>

<p>
Higher and more high rose the blustering wind,
sweeping before its angry breath the last brown
leaves of autumn; wildly the willows seemed to lash
the stormy air, as their supple branches were tossed
on the stormy blast; and from a distance up the
valley came the roaring of the sea, whose waves at
the horizon were brightened occasionally by a
ghastly glare of lightning.  Between the scudding
clouds, the moon's pale crescent was visible for a
time, above the ruins of King Arthur's castle on
steep Tintagel Head, a tremendous bluff (which is
cleft by a chasm from the mainland) adding thus to
the weird and wild aspect of the night; and what
served to increase the distraction of the wretched
mother, was the strange circumstance that of the
several messengers she sent forth, not one had yet
returned with tidings of any kind.  Suspense thus
became as it were, a bodily agony; she was led to
anticipate the worst; and Winny Braddon though
her heart was a prey to the keenest alarm and
anxiety, had to use almost affectionate force to
prevent her mistress, a weak and delicate little
woman as she was, from sallying forth in her
despair to prosecute the search in person.
</p>

<p>
Winny had but slender hope, she knew every foot of
her native shore, and was old enough to remember
many a dark and terrible story of the Cornish
wreckers, and when many a keg of French brandy,
and many a bale of good tobacco were brought from
the Scilly Isles, and without the knowledge of the
Coast Guard, landed slyly in some quiet nook and
cavern, where those to whom they were consigned
knew well when to find them; she knew many who
had perished in those secret places, when seeking
for the hidden wares; and it was for being engaged
in some of these little affairs, that her brother
Derrick, had to "levant" from the duchy, and
become a soldier in "the master's regiment"&mdash;the
Cornish Light Infantry.
</p>

<p>
Alternately Constance lay in a species of stupor
on a sofa, or started to the front door, where she
listened with eager ears, the rain falling on her pale
face, and the wind blowing about her hair, while
she could see the lanterns of the searchers,
glimmering like distant <i>ignes fatui</i>, as they proceeded
to and fro along the heights that overhung the
sea.
</p>

<p>
Denzil, she thought, was gone on life's highway,
and might never return; their daughter drowned&mdash;their
only child now it would seem, reft from them
suddenly and cruelly!  What would Richard say
on his return, and how was she to meet his eye?
What account was she to give of her maternal
solicitude and of her stewardship?  Yet in what
way was she to blame?
</p>

<p>
Yes! she did accuse herself.  The warnings and
hints of Winny Braddon came to memory.  She had
been remiss; she had permitted Sybil to wander too
much abroad with her sketch-book, and this was the
end of it; yet who, without some divine prescience,
could have foreseen a catastrophe so terrible?
How often had Denzil filled her mind with fear and
anxiety by his exploits among those very rocks, and
by his explorations of that horrible Pixies Hole,
where, too probably, his sister had perished
miserably; yet her bold and handsome Denzil, always
came back in safety to kiss and laugh away her fears
and upbraidings.
</p>

<p>
"Oh why is this terrible calamity put upon me?"
she moaned, as she lay with her face covered by her
hands, and her damp dishevelled hair; "is it but the
forerunner of a greater&mdash;if a <i>greater</i> there can be?
Can I have loved my husband and our children so
much that I have forgotten to love my God!"
</p>

<p>
And for a moment or two, she actually turned
over in her mind this strange idea&mdash;the first proposition
of the Mystics, which was, that the love of the
Supreme Being must be pure and disinterested;
that is, exempt from all views of interest, all care of
those we love on earth, and all hope of reward&mdash;tenets
defended by Madame de Guyon, and advocated
by the eloquent F√©n√©lon.
</p>

<p>
A sudden knocking at the front door, and a violent
pealing of the house-bell, caused her to start as if
with an electric shock.
</p>

<p>
Tidings had come at last&mdash;tidings that might fill
her soul with joy, or cause it to die within her.
</p>

<p>
"General Trecarrel, would speak with you
ma'am," said Winny Braddon, hurrying in with fresh
excitement in her tone and manner.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
LOST.
</h3>

<p>
The stranger who had called to Sybil by name,
and who had recognised her from the summit of the
cliff, was no other than General Trecarrel, the
same whom her parents had so studiously avoided;
but who nevertheless knew her well by sight, having
seen her on many occasions when riding abroad,
and on Sundays at church, whither she always
drove in her little pony phaeton, and he had always
admired her beauty greatly.
</p>

<p>
The General was not a very old man; he was
still looking for another command in India, and
though in affluent circumstances was yet an enthusiastic
soldier, who believed that military rank and
stars and ribbons, were the only things in this
world worth living for.  He was nearly six feet in
height&mdash;erect as a pike, and well built; his features
were handsome, his eyes dark and keen; his
complexion was well bronzed and dark, his short
shorn hair was becoming grey and grizzled, and his
manner, by force of habit, and the air to command,
was brief and authoritative.
</p>

<p>
He knew in a moment the great peril of the girl
on the beach below him; he saw that already the
tide was chafing in white surf at each horn of the
bay, round either of which she could alone escape
from the watery trap that enclosed her, unless taken
off the shore by a boat.  The General was on foot;
that part of the coast was very lonely and no house
or hut was, near; but intent upon her rescue, he
hurried away as fast as a limp in a wounded leg
(he had received a ball at Ghuznee) would permit
him, from place to place, in search of a boat; but
neither boat nor fisherman could be found in time
to take her off that perilous beach, ere the tide
covered it.
</p>

<p>
The evening darkened quickly, and the stormy
wind brought faster in the stormy sea.  Near the
gate-lodge of his own residence, he met Audley
Trevelyan strolling leisurely in the avenue with
his hands in his pockets, accompanied by his huge
dog, and enjoying a cigar before the bell should
ring to dress for dinner; but the havannah fairly
dropped from his lips in his surprise on beholding
the excited state of the usually calm and collected
General Trecarrel.
</p>

<p>
"What's the row, General&mdash;what the deuce is
the matter?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"A dreadful thing will occur&mdash;if it has not
already occurred&mdash;a poor girl on a solitary part of
the beach yonder, has been cut off by the tide, and
unless we can save her in ten minutes at farthest,
all will be over&mdash;yes, in ten minutes!" added
Trecarrel, looking at his gold watch&mdash;the gift of
Sir John Keane, with whom he had served in the
conquest of Cabul.
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens, let us get a boat at once!"
</p>

<p>
"There is not one to be had&mdash;the pilchard fishers
hereabout are all at sea!"
</p>

<p>
"Lower someone over the cliffs by a rope; I
have gone myself, thus, for a chough's egg, more
than once."
</p>

<p>
"The rocks are nearly two hundred feet in height
in some places, and the poor girl&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is she a lady, General?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and a handsome one, too."
</p>

<p>
"You know her then&mdash;she is not a stranger?"
</p>

<p>
"To me only&mdash;a Miss Devereaux, who resides at
Porthellick."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Who</i> do you say?" shouted Audley; "Sybil Devereaux?"
</p>

<p>
"The same."
</p>

<p>
"Merciful Heavens, let us do something at once!"
</p>

<p>
"True, but without a boat what can be done?"
</p>

<p>
"She cannot, she must not, she <i>shall not</i> be left
to perish thus, if I can save her!" exclaimed Audley
Trevelyan, with all the impetuosity of youth, and
with sudden emotions of terror, pity, and tenderness
combined.  He, usually so calm, quiet, and
apparently unimpressionable, to the surprise of the
General, now rushed to the stable-yard, and loudly,
even fiercely summoned grooms, gardeners, and
lodge-keepers, and with these carrying poles and
stable-lanterns, hurried towards the seashore, while
two messengers were despatched to the hut of a
fisherman, who lived about a mile distant, to get
his boat, or at least a coil of stout ropes, and they
succeeded in securing the latter; but his boat was
at sea, and was the same which Constance had seen
running round the headland for shelter at Portquin.
</p>

<p>
The alarm spread rapidly, and soon a dozen of
men at least were searching along the verge of the
cliffs in the dusk.  The sea was seen rolling its
waves round all the little bay now, and the base
of the cliffs was marked by a curling line of
snow-white foam alone.  Every vestige of sandy beach
had disappeared, and so had all trace of the poor
loiterer whom the General had last seen there!
</p>

<p>
Many a "halloo" was uttered, but vainly, for no
response came upwards from below.
</p>

<p>
Audley Trevelyan was very pale, and very silent,
though deeply excited.  He was not wont to indulge
in self-examination, and consequently he never knew
until now how dear this girl was to him&mdash;in fact,
how much he had begun to love her.
</p>

<p>
The dusk deepened into darkness, and a weird
effect was given to the wild rock scenery by the
fitful gleams of the lanterns carried along the edges
of those perilous cliffs by the searchers, who felt
that they were literally doing nothing, yet in the
spirit of humanity were loth to relinquish their
task, in which they were now joined by the terrified
and excited servants from the villa.  The wind was
rising fast, and its mournful voice, as it swept
through the bare branches of the old groves above
the bay, mingled with the booming of the waves
upon the rocks below.
</p>

<p>
Audley felt almost thankful for the gloom, as it
hid the workings of his features, and like a
thorough Englishman, he detested alike a scene
and to be a subject for speculation; but now the
deep baying of his Thibet dog among a clump of
bushes and gorse, attracted the marked attention of
the searchers.
</p>

<p>
"The dog has found some track or trace; he
never barks thus, save for some cogent reason!"
exclaimed Audley, as he hastened to the spot.
</p>

<p>
"Plaise sur, the dog do hear or see summat,"
added Michael Treherne, an old and decrepit miner,
who in his earlier years had been an "underground
captain" in Botallack mine, and one of the best
wrestlers in the duchy, and who had hobbled forth,
staff in hand, to assist in the search; "if the dog be
on the right road, we be on the wrang.  But take
'ee care, surs; there's the shaft of a main old mine
hereabouts; and out of it, in its time, there have
come many a keenly lode o' tin and goodly bunch
of copper."
</p>

<p>
"I know the place, Michael," cried Audley;
"Heavens above! she must be in the Pixies' Hole,
which, as you are all likely aware, opens into the
shaft."
</p>

<p>
"Just so, Mr. Trevelyan; through that same
hole, the water was pumped into the sea in my
grandfeyther's time&mdash;and that warn't yesterday,
sur."
</p>

<p>
"How old are you, Michael?" asked the General,
lending the old man his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Seventy past; few miners live to my time, and
'tis ten years since I was underground," replied
Treherne with a sigh; "I can mind o' 'ee a small
booy, General, robbin' my garden o' apples."
</p>

<p>
Proceeding cautiously about a hundred yards
back from the verge of the cliffs to the place where
the dog was baying, they found amid the tangled
gorse bushes, the mound of slag and other debris,
now covered with rank grass and weeds, in the
centre of which yawned the round mouth of the
ancient mine; and as they drew near the dog
continued to bay the louder, with its forefeet
outstretched, and its nose in the air.  Then it
began to fawn and leap upon its master, with such
ponderous gambols, that more than once he was
nearly thrown to the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Down, Rajah&mdash;down, sir! keep quiet, dog," he
exclaimed, and while he spoke, something like the
cry of a female came to his ear; "oh, General, I
see it all now!  She has been driven by the tide
into the Pixies' hole, and is even now on the verge
of this shaft; should she be ignorant of its
existence, she may fall into the mine and be dead ere
she reaches the bottom!"
</p>

<p>
"It must all be over with the poor lass,
Mr. Trevelyan," said the old miner, shaking his head;
"hear ye <i>that</i>."
</p>

<p>
And, as they listened, they could hear above the
moaning of the wind and the surging of the sea, the
sound of water pouring within the shaft of the
mine, and falling apparently to a vast depth below.
A sense of the deep profundity that yawned before
them, made all save Audley and the old miner,
Treherne, shrink, with faces that seemed pale in
the fitful gleams of the lanterns, and now the latter
spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Aw dear, aw dear! dost hear, sur?  The tide
has risen to upper mouth o' the Pixies' Hole, and
is now pouring down into the lower level o' the
mine, so if the poor lady beant drowned in one
place, she will be at the bottom o' tother."
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be some probability of such
being the case; and though Audley was horror-struck
with the suggestion, he said with apparent
calmness, the result of a great effort,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The upper mouth you speak of, Michael, is
about fifty feet below where we stand; surely, the
tide could never reach it, even at full flood?"
</p>

<p>
"But who will venture down to see?" asked
Treherne, almost with a grin on his hard old
visage.
</p>

<p>
"I shall!"
</p>

<p>
"You, Mr. Trevelyan&mdash;you, sur?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Dare you go down, Trevelyan, with that terrible
sound in your ears?" asked the General, and all
present murmured the same thing, save Sybil's
servants, who moaned and wrung their hands.
</p>

<p>
"Dare I go down?" repeated Audley, "when a
woman is in the case&mdash;a lady&mdash;Sybil Devereaux!
To whom are you talking, General?  Have I not
for a joke taken a letter to the Devil's Post Office,
and will I shrink for this?" he asked, referring to
the deep and dangerous chasm at Kinance Cove,
where the sea bellows for ever with a thundering
sound, and from time to time hurls a column of
water furiously through an aperture, when those
who are adventurous enough to descend in the dark
and deliver a letter, as if to the presiding Genius of
the place, will find it rudely torn from their fingers
by an inward current of air, accompanying the
reflux of the sea.  "We have blocks and tackle
with us," continued Audley; "rig them to poles
laid across the shaft, and by Jove, I'll go down
with a lantern; quick, my lads, for God's sake lose
no time!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you not afraid of gas&mdash;or foul air,
Trevelyan?" asked the General.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean to go to the bottom."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not; but if the rope should break?"
</p>

<p>
"In that case, it won't matter what I meet with,"
was the grimly significant reply; "but be careful,
my good fellows, for I trust my life to you in this
instance."
</p>

<p>
"If the tackle did break, thee'd soon be in
jowds" (<i>i.e.</i>, pieces), said Treherne, with a
saturnine smile.
</p>

<p>
An oar and a stout pole, which two of the party
carried, were laid across the mouth of the shaft.
</p>

<p>
A double-sheaved block was securely lashed to
them; a strong rope was rove through the sheaves,
and a species of cradle was formed for the
adventurous Audley Trevelyan.
</p>

<p>
Long familiar with his native rocks, the latter
when a bold boy, had clambered by Bodrigan's
Leap at Portmellin,* when seeking for puffins' nests,
and could look without shrinking from the steeps
of Gurnard's Head, Tol Pedn Penwith, and the
fantastic cliffs of Tintagel.  He had been doted on
by the miners, with whom he had often descended
the deepest shafts, clad like themselves in flannel
shirt and trousers.  Thus attired, he had explored
the vast levels and silent galleries by the dim light
of a feeble candle, while, as Sybil told of Denzil, he
could hear the roar of the Atlantic over his head,
and the boulders dashed by its force on the bluffs of
the Land's End; and thence beyond, in levels half
a mile out at sea, where the passing ships glided
like silent phantoms many a fathom far above where
he wandered.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* So called from Sir Henry Bodrigan, who in the reign of
Henry VII. sprang down the cliff, when flying from his neighbours
Trevannion and Edgecumbe, who sought to capture or slay him.
He was so little injured by the fall, that he reached a vessel sailing
near the shore, and escaped to France.  A mound, called the
Castle Hill, and a farm-house, once part of a splendid mansion, are
all that now remain of the abode of this fine old Cornish family.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Fearlessly he tied himself to the cradle which old
Michael Treherne prepared for him; a lantern was
hung at his neck, leaving his arms free, and now a
dozen of strong and careful hands were laid on the
ropes.
</p>

<p>
"Lower away, my lads," cried he, almost gaily;
and with something like a gasp of anxiety in his
throat, the General saw his young friend's face
disappear as they lowered him into that awful orifice,
the mouth of a shaft that went down a thousand
feet and more.
</p>

<p>
"Steady, my booys!" cried old Treherne, in a
species of glee.
</p>

<p>
Those who witnessed this descent were none of
them, perhaps, very impressionable men; yet even
to them, there was a gloomy horror in the idea of
the vast profundity of the deserted mine, over which
Trevelyan swung; and the wildness of the night,
the storm at sea, the whistling and howling of the
wind as it swept the rocky promontories, and rolled
the waves in foam against them, were not without
their due effects upon the mind.

CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE SEARCH.
</h3>

<p>
"He's a braave booy, sartainly!" said old
Michael Treherne, admiringly, in his queer Cornish
accent, "it is like him and like his family&mdash;the
Trevelyans of Rhoscadzhel.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By Tre, Pol and Pen,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the Cornish men.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He'd face Tregeagle himself&mdash;lower away gently,
lads.  His ancestors existed hundreds of years ago;
and for the matter o' that, I spose so did mine; we
be all old Cornish <i>keth</i>."*
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
* People.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Audley Trevelyan would freely have risked his
life to save anyone&mdash;of course a woman more than
all; but how glorious was this!  The peril he
risked&mdash;for no ordinary amount of nerve was
requisite for him who swung thus over the profundity
of the ancient mine&mdash;was for his lovely little friend
of the sketch-book; the Naiad of the moorland
tarn&mdash;she who seemed not indisposed to love him, and
whose heart he might yet make his own.
</p>

<p>
"But Heaven!" thought he; "that impulsive
little heart may be&mdash;alas&mdash;still enough by this
time!"
</p>

<p>
And even as this disastrous fear occurred to him,
the roar of the falling water was heard on the
lower level of the empty mine, more than a
thousand feet below him, while the lantern he
carried cast strange gleams on the damp, slimy, and
discoloured masonry of the shaft, after he left
behind, or rather above him, the fringe of weeds
and gorse, that grew about the mouth; yet in less
than a minute he was assured that the water he
heard falling, proceeded, not from the flow of the
tide, as he and his companions foreboded, but from
some subterranean spring falling into the shaft, far
below the upper entrance of the Pixies' Hole; and
anything more weird, dreary, and ghastly than that
cavernous fissure which now opened off it on one
side, and which he was preparing cautiously to
explore, it would be difficult to conceive.
</p>

<p>
From its rocky and ragged mouth, which was
covered with white and pendant stalactites and
hideous fungi, on which the light of his lantern fell
with fitful rays, its interior receded away into dark
and gloomy blackness and uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
"Good Heaven!" muttered Audley, "the poor
girl cannot be here.  Should she have fallen down
the shaft!"&mdash;was his next terrible thought.
</p>

<p>
"Are ee saafe, sur?" cried Treherne, peering
down from above.
</p>

<p>
"All right, old fellow&mdash;stop lowering and make
fast the rope; I am just at the place, and a horrid
one it is."
</p>

<p>
Ere he entered it, and cast off the cradle by
which he had descended, he could hear in the
obscurity beyond the surging or gurgling sound
of the tide, at the lower end; and a nervous chill
that he might find Sybil drowned, came over his
heart.
</p>

<p>
"Well, by Jove!" he muttered; "of all the places
in this world, to search for a young lady, who would
think of this&mdash;down the shaft of a devilish old
copper mine!  I have seen some queer things in
India, but this out-herods them all!"
</p>

<p>
Carrying the lantern so that its light should
precede and guide his steps, he had barely gone
twenty paces, when he discerned something white
amid the dense gloom.  Within but a few feet of the
still encroaching water, a female figure was lying
on a shelf of rock, from which she started into a
half sitting posture, and gazed upward at him,
with a wild and startled expression, in which
hope and fear, joy and wonder, were singularly
mingled.
</p>

<p>
She was that Sybil Devereaux of whom he was in
search; her dress, a white pique, all soiled,
bedrabbled and wet, her fine dark hair dishevelled and
sodden, her hat and veil gone, and her whole aspect
forlorn and pitiable.
</p>

<p>
"I am saved!" she exclaimed in a wailing and
excited voice; "I thank Heaven&mdash;I thank kind
God that you are come to me; but how&mdash;and who
are you that have had the courage&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Audley&mdash;Audley Trevelyan&mdash;don't you know me,
Miss Devereaux?" said he, as he placed the lantern
on a rock, and raised her tenderly in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Audley!" she exclaimed, and her head fell
upon his shoulder, for she was weak as a child and
past all exertion.  She had never called him by his
Christian name before, and while he felt his heart
swell with a new emotion of pleasure, he ventured
tenderly to kiss her cheek, and then he became
aware how cold and chill it was.  She seemed
scarcely conscious of the act, though she said in a
broken voice,
</p>

<p>
"Mamma&mdash;my poor mamma shall thank you, sir&mdash;I
cannot speak my own thoughts&mdash;they are too
terrible and my gratitude is too deep for words."
</p>

<p>
"From my soul, I thank Heaven, that I came in
time to save you!  A little longer here, my dearest
girl, and you must have perished of cold!" said he
as he perceived with genuine anxiety how pale she
was and how the whole of her delicate frame
shivered, but his words or manner seemed to recall
her energies, for she tried to smile and said,
</p>

<p>
"I shall have a strange story to write of to
Denzil, and tell my papa when he returns."
</p>

<p>
"Have ee found her zur&mdash;is the young lady
saafe?" cried a voice there was no mistaking, down
the shaft.
</p>

<p>
"Safe and sound, Treherne," replied Trevelyan,
whose voice made strange echoes in the cavernous
recesses of the place; "we shall come up together,
so take care my friends, for there will be a heavier
strain on the rope&mdash;a double weight now.  Permit
me to lead you, Miss Devereaux&mdash;or, may I not call
you Sybil?" he added, as his voice trembled a
little.
</p>

<p>
"You may call me what you please," replied Sybil
with something of her usual frankness, "I owe
my life to you," she added feebly, while clinging to
his arm.
</p>

<p>
"To me, after Rajah who guided us here, no
doubt on hearing you cry for aid&mdash;so with the
permission you accord, I shall call you Sybil&mdash;yes
dearest Sybil, permit me to blindfold you."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"You may become giddy&mdash;terrified."
</p>

<p>
"I submit myself to you," she answered, and he
tied his handkerchief over her eyes, and while doing
so, to resist touching her lovely little lips with his
own, was impossible.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me for this, Sybil," said he, as the action
brought a little colour to her pale cheek, "but I love
you, love you dearly.  Elsewhere, we shall talk of
this&mdash;come, allow me to be your guide."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we not wait till the tide ebbs, and escape
by the sands?" she asked, and shrinking as his arm
encircled her.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest girl, you would die of cold ere that took
place."
</p>

<p>
Thus from terror and despair on Sybil's part, and
from a proud and joyous sense of exultation, on that
of Trevelyan, there came about abruptly, a
<i>d√©nouement</i> which might have been long of developing
itself, even with those who were so young and
enthusiastic, a declaration of love upon one hand, and
a tacit acceptance of it on the other, for gratitude
mastered the regard already formed in the heart of
the girl.
</p>

<p>
Audley was now in that delightful state of the
tender passion, when to see even the skirt, to hear
the voice or to breathe the same atmosphere, with its
object, had a charm; then how much greater was the
joy of having her all to himself, and to feel that too
probably, she owed her life to him!
</p>

<p>
"You do not&mdash;do not&mdash;love&mdash;" she faltered and paused.
</p>

<p>
"Whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Rose Trecarrel?"
</p>

<p>
"I love but you, and I bless God for the
opportunity given me for testifying that love, by
serving and saving you&mdash;Sybil&mdash;dear Sybil for so let
me call you now and for ever."
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce <i>are</i> you about, Trevelyan?  Do
you mean to stay down there all night&mdash;or is the
lady ill?  That dreary hole can be neither
romantic nor pleasant, I should fancy."
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of the General hailing him now.
</p>

<p>
"Here we come, sir," replied Audley, as he
fastened the rope cradle securely round his body
and courageously took Sybil in his arms.  It was
no doubt delightful to hold her in an embrace so
close, and to feel her clinging to him, but a thrill of
intense anxiety passed over all his nerves, and it
seemed as if the hair of his head bristled up, when
he found himself swinging at the end of a rope over
that dreadful abyss, down which the lantern, as it
chanced to fall from his hand, vanished as if into the
bowels of the earth, for the lower level of that old
mine, was far below the sea.  As for poor Sybil, she
felt only a terror that amounted to a species of
torpor&mdash;a numbness of all sense.
</p>

<p>
"Now pull together, my booys!" cried the cheerful
voice of Michael Treherne, "one, two&mdash;one, two&mdash;<i>ho</i>
and here they come out of the <i>knacked bal</i>!"
for so the Cornish miners designate an abandoned
mine, as it is among his class, and in the mines,
that words of the old language linger.
</p>

<p>
And in less than a minute, Audley and Sybil were
at the surface and in the grasp of strong hands that
placed them safely on terra firma, when, overcome
by all she had endured, the former immediately
fainted.
</p>

<p>
"The poor child is as wet as a <i>quilquin</i>" (a frog),
said Treherne with commiseration.
</p>

<p>
"She requires instant attention," said the General
kindly; "let her own servants take her at once to
your cottage, Treherne, as it is the nearest place in
this stormy night.  See to this, Audley, while I hurry
down to Porthellick and relieve the anxiety of her
mother.  Give orders to have the carriage sent
there for her.  By the way, Audley, is not this the
girl that Rose chaffs you about?"
</p>

<p>
"The same, sir," replied Trevelyan, whose
heightened colour was unseen in the dark.
</p>

<p>
"How strange!  Rose is such a quiz, you will
never hear the end of this."
</p>

<p>
"She is the daughter of an officer&mdash;a Captain
Devereaux."
</p>

<p>
"I have never met him&mdash;of what corps?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"To Mike's cottage with her, and lose no time.
Here my lads, all of you go to Trevanion's Tavern,
and score to me what you drink.  The night is
rough and wet."
</p>

<p>
"Thank'ee sir," replied Treherne, while the
others all bowed and scraped and pulled their
forelocks; "my old woman 'll keep the young lady
safe, till her pony-kittereen or your carriage comes
for her; and we'll drink your health, and
Mr. Trevelyan's too&mdash;aye, and the old Cornish toast of
'Fish, tin, and copper,' in summat better than
Devonshire cider."
</p>

<p>
So, while Sybil in Audley's care was taken to the
cottage of the old miner, and the latter with those
who had joined in the search departed to enjoy the
bounty of the General, the latter limped off to visit
Constance and relate the story of her daughter's
escape and safety.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
INTELLIGENCE AT LAST.
</h3>

<p>
On seeing Constance without her bonnet, and
with her dark hair somewhat in disorder, the first
impression of the General was, how extremely like
her daughter she proved, and how very youthful
too; for her figure, as we have elsewhere said, was
petite; her features were minute, beautiful and full
of animation at all times, but never more so than
now, when she started forward on the entrance of
the visitor, with her delicate hands uplifted, her
fine eyes sparkling through their tears, full of hope
and inquiry, and her lips parted, showing the
whiteness and faultless regularity of her teeth.
</p>

<p>
"You have news for me, General?" she faltered.
</p>

<p>
"Happily, good news, madam," said he, bowing
low; "your daughter is safe and well."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir&mdash;oh, General Trecarrel, how can I
thank you?"
</p>

<p>
"By composing yourself, my dear madam," he
replied, leading her to a chair; but Constance
became almost hysterical; she clasped his hand
in hers, and almost sought to kiss it, in expression
of her deep gratitude, greatly to the confusion of
the old soldier, who was Englishman enough to
dislike a "scene."
</p>

<p>
"Under the circumstances, no apology is necessary
for the abruptness of my visit," said he; "we
are pretty near neighbours, and I hope shall
ultimately be friends, though, singular to say, I
have never had the pleasure of meeting Captain
Devereaux."
</p>

<p>
These words recalled Constance to a sense&mdash;the
ever-bitter sense&mdash;of the awkwardness of her
position, and she faltered out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Captain Devereaux is absent at present&mdash;abroad
indeed&mdash;but I hope he shall soon be home
now.  And our dear daughter&mdash;she escaped the
rising tide&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By fortunately being able to find shelter in the
Pixies' Hole, from which she was promptly rescued
by a young friend&mdash;a brother-officer of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how I shall bless him and ever treasure his
name."
</p>

<p>
"He is Mr. Audley Trevelyan, and has conveyed
her, in the first place, to old Mike Treherne's
cottage.  She was drenched by rain and spray,
suffering from chill, and overcome with terror."
</p>

<p>
"My poor little Sybil!"
</p>

<p>
The General did not add to the mother's alarm
by adding that he had left Sybil insensible, but
only said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"She should not return till to-morrow, when
perhaps the rain may cease, and the storm abate;
but I have ordered my carriage, and she shall have
the use of it with pleasure.  It must be here in
a few minutes now."
</p>

<p>
Constance could only murmur her heartfelt
thanks; but now, more than ever, she felt the
peculiarity of her position&mdash;its extreme awkwardness,
and its doubtful aspect.  It was but a few
weeks since her husband, now known as Lord
Lamorna, had stood by the General's side at the
late lord's grave, amid a crowd of bareheaded
tenantry, and here they were talking of him as
"Captain Devereaux!"
</p>

<p>
Sybil's cousin-german had saved and protected
her, thus cementing the acquaintance begun by
chance at the little lake upon the moor, and was
with her now too, probably; he was her husband's
nephew, and while that husband was absent, with
her own rank, name, and his concealed, she dared
not avow the relationship that existed among them
all!  Poor Constance felt her cheek grow paler,
with the sickly thoughts that oppressed her heart,
as she muttered under her breath&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Patience yet a while, and, with God's help, dear
Richard shall see me through all this!"
</p>

<p>
In a few words the General, with military brevity,
related the whole affair of the evening; the
providential discovery of her daughter in the chasm, by
her voice, as it was rightly conjectured, having
reached the ears of Audley's Thibet mastiff; but
for which circumstance she must have perished of
cold and exhaustion, or perhaps fallen down the
shaft of the old mine and never been heard of
again, her fate remaining a mystery to all&mdash;contingencies,
the contemplation of which appalled the
heart of the poor mother, who said in a very faint
voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My daughter is long in returning to me.  Oh,
sir, can it be that you are kindly concealing
something from me?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, madam, the tempestuous state of the
weather and the feeble condition of the young lady
herself require&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is it! my daughter is ill&mdash;dying
perhaps, while I am idly talking here.  Winny&mdash;Winny
Braddon, my bonnet and cloak; I shall set
forth this instant for Treherne's cottage!"
</p>

<p>
"I assure you, madame, that my carriage was at
her disposal, and it shall bring your daughter
home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, General, the gratitude of my heart&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;there, please don't thank me for a little
common humanity," continued the kind old soldier,
"but give my compliments&mdash;General Trecarrel's
compliments&mdash;to Captain Devereaux when he returns,
and say that I think he ought, in etiquette,
to have waited upon me as his senior officer; for
such was the fashion in my young days, when two
brethren of the sword took up their quarters in a
district so secluded as this; and I should like my
girls to know your daughter."
</p>

<p>
"I have a son, too, General&mdash;my dear Denzil&mdash;who
left us but lately to join his Regiment."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;indeed&mdash;you quite interest me.  Where is
it stationed?"
</p>

<p>
"In India&mdash;far, far from me."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you could not have him always
at your apron-strings.  What, or which, is his
corps?"
</p>

<p>
"The Cornish Light Infantry."
</p>

<p>
"My own Regiment!  I am the full colonel of
it: why did he not leave a card with me on
appointment?&mdash;he must have known of my whereabouts."
</p>

<p>
A cloud came over the fair open countenance of
Trecarrel, and Constance felt that, in the further
prosecution of their systematic incognito, a breach
of military etiquette and punctilio had taken
place.
</p>

<p>
"My young friend Trevelyan is in the same
corps," said the General, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
Constance knew that too, and that it had been
the Regiment of her husband during their happiest
days at Montreal; but when with it he had borne
his family surname, and <i>not</i> that of Devereaux.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, what a tangled web we weave,<br />
  "When first we practise to deceive!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
So thought Constance, and who could not quite
foresee the end of the web.  Her present
perplexities were increasing, and her usually pale
cheeks began to blush scarlet.
</p>

<p>
But now, to her intense relief, the sound of
wheels and hoofs at the door, followed by quick
steps in the entrance, announced an arrival, and in
a moment more mother and daughter were weeping
joyfully in each other's arms.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest mamma&mdash;darling mamma!  Oh the
joy of being safe with you again!  An age seems to
have elapsed since I left you this evening!"
</p>

<p>
And old Winny Braddon came in for her share
of caresses, while the General and Trevelyan,
though they now began to feel themselves rather
<i>de trop</i>, looked on with smiles of pleasure.  So full
of joy was Constance at the restoration of Sybil,
that she never noticed the quaint and coarse (though
comfortably dry) costume which the careful wife of
Treherne had substituted for her wet and sodden
habiliments.
</p>

<p>
Audley's quick and practised eye saw that
Constance was a woman possessing more than an
ordinary share of beauty and refinement.  He took
in the whole details of the drawing-room, and
perceived by a glance that the occupants of this
secluded villa "in the willow-glen&mdash;those peculiar
Devereaux," as the Trecarrel girls called them,
were evidently people of the best and most
cultivated taste, for the buhl or marquetterie tables,
consoles, and cabinets exhibited selections from the
most chaste productions of Dresden and S√®vres;
delicate Venetian bronzes, quaint Majolica vases and
groups, some relics from Herculaneum; and other
objects (more familiar to him) from India and
Burmah were there&mdash;four-armed gods and other
idols in silver or ivory.
</p>

<p>
Pausing for a moment in her caresses, Constance
turned towards Audley Trevelyan with a pleading
glance of irresolution, yet one of wonderful sweetness.
</p>

<p>
"My young friend, Mr. Trevelyan," said the
General; "allow me to introduce him, Mrs. Devereaux."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, to you I owe the gratitude of a
lifetime?" she exclaimed in an accent of touching
tenderness.
</p>

<p>
He seemed so like her absent Denzil, that all her
heart yearned to him, and in a genuine transport of
gratitude she embraced him with such <i>empressement</i>,
that in a woman so young apparently for her
maternal character, and so very handsome too,
rather perplexed Trevelyan, who said,
</p>

<p>
"You owe me no thanks&mdash;indeed, indeed, you do
not.  I did but my duty&mdash;I obeyed only the dictates
of humanity; and I assure you that you are quite as
much indebted to Rajah as to me, Mrs. Devereaux."
</p>

<p>
The name he used recalled her to herself, and
the peculiarity of her position as regarded him&mdash;the
secret she could not yet reveal; and turning
away as an expression of confusion come over her
face, she stooped, and casting her arms round the
great Thibet mastiff, caressed it with a grace and
playfulness that partook of girlish glee.
</p>

<p>
By this time Sybil was reclining wearily, and
with an air of utter exhaustion and languor, on a
sofa.  Her face was very pale, save when a kind
of hectic flush passed over it, and her eyes seemed
unnaturally bright.  Even to the unpractised
observation of the two gentlemen it was evident that
they had better retire, and, after exchanging a
glance suggestive of this, they both rose, hat in
hand.
</p>

<p>
"You will, I hope, permit me to call to-morrow
and make inquiries?" said Audley Trevelyan.
</p>

<p>
Constance bowed, and her tongue trembled:
what she said she scarcely knew, but it was a
muttered wish of some kind, with many thanks and
reference to her husband's return, all oddly
combined.  That she laboured under some species of
hidden restraint was quite apparent to the perception
of him she addressed, and also to the General;
and so, after the usual well-bred wishes that both
ladies should soon recover from the effects of their
recent terror, they withdrew together; and as the
sound of their carriage wheels died away in the
willow avenue, all other sounds, and the light too,
seemed to pass away from Sybil, as she sank
gradually back, became insensible, and was conveyed
to bed by Winny Braddon and her startled mother,
who summoned medical aid without delay.
</p>

<p>
The next day found her in a species of nervous
fever.  She had undergone too much of mental fear
and bodily suffering for a nature so delicate as hers,
and remained for a time unconscious of all around
her.  Slowly and gradually, like water filtering
through a rock&mdash;as some one describes the struggles
of returning sensibility&mdash;she became aware that she
was in her own bed, with her mother on one side
and Winny Braddon on the other in watchful
attendance; then, with a shudder, she would recall
the horrors she had escaped, and clasp her hands
as she had done ten years before, when a little
child in prayer.
</p>

<p>
Then exhaustion would bring sleep, but a sleep
haunted by dreams, and, at times, visions wild as
those of an opium-eater; thus, for many a night,
long after this period, the episodes of that eventful
evening would come back to memory with all their
harrowing details: the advancing tide rolling against
the impending cliffs and thundering in the Pixies'
Hole, after it had swallowed the drenched sand;
her retreating step by step fearfully and breathlessly
before it, in terror of being drowned on one hand
and of falling down the mine on the other!
</p>

<p>
Anon, she would imagine herself swung up that
terrible shaft through darkness and space, and that
the rope was just on the eve of <i>parting</i>, when she
would wake with a half-stifled scream to find that
she was in the arms of her mamma, who was
soothing and caressing her.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE TRECARRELS.
</h3>

<p>
Duly next day, at a proper visiting-hour, the
handsome and well-appointed carriage of General
Trecarrel, occupied only by his two daughters and
Audley Trevelyan, was seen bowling down the
avenue of the villa at Porthellick, with Rajah
bounding before it in as much glee as if at home in
Thibet, "the northern land of snow," where many
a time he had scoured along the slopes of the
Himalaya range and the Dwalaghiri in pursuit of
the Cashmere goat and the Tartarian yak; but, as
the event proved, the visit was in vain: the two ladies
could only leave their cards, as they were informed
that both Mrs. and Miss Devereaux were too much
indisposed after the events of yesterday to receive
visitors.
</p>

<p>
"It will be a case which warm drinks and cosseting
will soon cure, I hope," said Rose, shrugging
her pretty shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Where to, Miss Trecarrel?" asked the footman,
touching his hat ere he sprang to his place behind.
</p>

<p>
"To Bodmin," replied the elder sister: "we
have shopping to do, Mr. Trevelyan;" and after a
pause she added, "I have told you that they were
odd people, those Devereaux; we were fools to
come&mdash;don't you think so, Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, Mab."
</p>

<p>
"Do not judge so harshly," urged Audley.  "What
may be more probable than that both should feel
excited after the last night's terror and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Chivalry," suggested Rose Trecarrel, a little
malice glittering in her fine eyes; but Audley
remained silent.
</p>

<p>
Mabel and Rose Trecarrel were both eminently
handsome girls.  The elder was tall and showy,
having dark grey eyes that filled, at times, with
unusual lustre and had a wonderful variety of
expression, but her chief beauties were perhaps her
purity of complexion and the quantity and
magnificence of her rich brown hair.
</p>

<p>
Rose was somewhat her counterpart&mdash;a large but
very graceful girl, with clear, sparkling, hazel eyes,
and hair much of the same hue, though her lashes
and eyebrows were dark and well defined.  Without
attempting to describe her nose, we shall simply
say it was a very pretty one, that seemed exactly
to suit the expression of her eyes and the
full-lipped yet little and alluring mouth below.  Both
girls were always dressed rather in the extreme of
the mode, and were sure to be prime favourites at
all balls, races, or meets to see the hounds throw
off; and no entertainment in that part of the
duchy was deemed complete without "the
Trecarrels."  No friend had ever accused them of being
flirts, though fair enemies had frequently done so.
</p>

<p>
The General was very proud of his two daughters,
and felt certain that both would make most eligible
and wealthy marriages, when he took them to India,
where he was in expectation daily of obtaining an
important command.
</p>

<p>
For the time Audley Trevelyan was, what others
had been, and others yet might be, a kind of
privileged dangler in attendance on both sisters, and
seemed to share their smiles and return attention
to both in a pretty equal manner; thus both were
somewhat disposed to resent the new and sudden
interest he manifested in Sybil Devereaux.
</p>

<p>
Both were eminently dashing girls.  Mabel, the
elder, was perhaps the statelier of the two, but the
beauty and manner of Rose were more sparkling and
dazzling.  Both sisters were highly accomplished,
and both had that affected indifference to their own
attractions, which is perhaps an indication of the
strongest and most ineradicable vanity&mdash;for of those
attractions they knew the full power and value.
</p>

<p>
"But who are those Devereaux?" asked Mabel,
as a turn of the road hid the villa, during a pause
filled up only by the subdued noise of the carriage
wheels in their patent axle-boxes.
</p>

<p>
"You should know by this time, Trevelyan,"
added Rose, looking at him from under the long
fringes of her eyes and her parasol, as she lay well
back indolently yet gracefully among the soft
cushions of the carriage.
</p>

<p>
"Nay; how should I, when you, who are neighbours,
know nothing?  Her father was a captain in
some Line Regiment."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Her</i> father&mdash;of whom were we speaking?" asked
Rose.
</p>

<p>
Trevelyan coloured perceptibly, and Mabel
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she occupies his thoughts already, Mab!
He was of some Line Regiment, that is pretty vague,
and scarcely suits our Cornish standard of such
things as family and so forth&mdash;least of all the
standard formed by your uncle, the late Lord
Lamorna."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he was an absurd old goose&mdash;mad with
pride, in fact."
</p>

<p>
"And barely remembered you in his will?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely so," replied Audley, half amused and
half provoked.
</p>

<p>
"They visit no one, and they make no acquaintances,"
said Rose, resuming the theme.
</p>

<p>
"They settled here without an introduction, I
have heard, and gave it to be understood that they
declined all acquaintance save with the Rector and
Doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Neither of whom, Mab, are particular to a
shade.  I should not wonder, Audley, if your
'captain' were some returned convict or retired
housebreaker in easy circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"Rose, you are too severe," urged Trevelyan;
"Mrs. Devereaux is a kind of idol among the poor
people here."
</p>

<p>
"We must all admit that she excels in chicken
broth, is knowing in coals and tea, and great in
corduroys, tobacco, and blankets; but fasten my
bracelet, please," and she held forth coquettishly a
slender wrist and a well-shaped hand, tightly cased
in the finest of straw-coloured kid; and every
movement of Rose Trecarrel, however quick and
unstudied, was full of the poetry of action.  "Thanks.
If you will not admit that the mother of your fair
friend is odd, you must that her father is so&mdash;or at
least is ignorant of military etiquette, if he is a
military man."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"He has never left his card upon papa, which,
in a solitary place like this, papa thinks he ought
to have done, as it is the fashion in the service&mdash;going
out I am aware&mdash;for the junior officer to wait
upon the senior, though uninvited."
</p>

<p>
"Though a bore at times, it was a good old
custom, I admit, but like many other fashions is as
much gone out as square letter-paper, sand-boxes
and sealing wax, stage coaches and queues."
</p>

<p>
"Then his son," she continued in an aggrieved
tone, "on being appointed to papa's own Regiment,
never had the politeness to leave a card upon us
either!"
</p>

<p>
"Rose, you are quite a <i>Code Militaire</i>," said
Trevelyan, laughing again.  "Those Devereaux are
thought handsome&mdash;I mean the mother and
daughter."
</p>

<p>
"I have no wish to disparage the taste of the
Cornish gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"None could afford to treat their taste with more
indifference than you and Miss Trecarrel, who are
both&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Both what?" asked Mabel, quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Above all comparison."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we did not leave all our gallantry in the old
coal-mine!"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, Rose," said Trevelyan, "it was
originally a tin-mine."
</p>

<p>
"Pity it was not brass&mdash;eh, Audley?" replied
Rose, laughing with a voice like a silver bell.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, Rose," said Mabel, "you and
Trevelyan are usually such good friends that I shall
not have you to spar thus."
</p>

<p>
"We don't spar, it is only 'barrack-room chaff,' in
which, as you may perceive, Mr. Trevelyan excels,"
retorted the piqued belle.
</p>

<p>
The truth was rather apparent to Audley, that
the pretty&mdash;nay, the beautiful and hazel-eyed
Rose was nettled, and seriously so.  Hitherto she
had considered the handsome ex-Lieutenant of
Hussars, and now of the Cornish Light Infantry,
as her own peculiar property&mdash;even more than
her sister.  He was to be her papa's Aide-de-camp
in India&mdash;she had settled this, <i>nem. con.</i>; and
while on leave at home, he was to be her dangler,
secret slave, and open adorer&mdash;husband in the end
perhaps, if nothing better "turned up;" for Audley's
expectations from his father, the barrister, as one
of a family of five, were slender enough; and here
he was too probably smitten with a little chit-faced
interloper whom no one knew anything about!
</p>

<p>
There was a pause in the conversation, during
which the carriage had passed St. Teath and
St. Kew, with their quaint churches, and that of
Egloshayle, on the right bank of the Camel, where
it peeped up among the trees, when Rose returned
to the charge.
</p>

<p>
"And you actually swung together at the end of a
rope."
</p>

<p>
"At the end of a rope, as you say."
</p>

<p>
"How romantic!&mdash;how charming!"
</p>

<p>
"At least in one sense; yet I was glad enough
when it was all over in safety."
</p>

<p>
"What! though doubtless, as Byron says,
</p>

<p>
  'The situation had its charm.'"<br />
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"Fie, Rose&mdash;you quote <i>Don Juan</i>!" exclaimed
Mabel.
</p>

<p>
"And why should not I, Mab, if the passage
seems so familiar to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Rose, you are incorrigible!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Audley, your fellow-soldiers must be
proud of you when they hear of this feat of arms."
</p>

<p>
"We say <i>brother</i>-soldiers in the service," replied
Trevelyan.
</p>

<p>
"I submit to the correction; it is like one from
papa, who deems all civilians stupid fellows.  And
so you think she is a paragon of loveliness?"
continued Rose Trecarrel, so bent on the game of
tormenting him, that she cared little for showing
her hand.
</p>

<p>
"I did not say so&mdash;do you, Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"Call me <i>Miss</i> Rose, if you please," said she, with
a charming air of pique on her lovely little lip.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;where were we?"
</p>

<p>
"About the beauty of the girl you rescued&mdash;were
slung in a rope with.  How funny!" said Mabel.
</p>

<p>
"Of her beauty you can judge for yourselves; I
have nothing to do with it," replied he wearily.
</p>

<p>
"Fortunate for you," laughed Rose, "as the girl's
position in society seems so dubious, Audley."
</p>

<p>
"Call me Mr. Trevelyan, please, as we are to be
on distant terms."
</p>

<p>
"Let us only have you in India, where we shall be
ere long," said she, shaking her parasol threateningly,
"and I shall have papa to put you under arrest."
</p>

<p>
"For what?"
</p>

<p>
"Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"As how, my fair friend?'
</p>

<p>
"Behaving rudely, petulantly, and insolently."
</p>

<p>
"To a pretty girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;moreover, a daughter of the general on
whose staff he is serving."
</p>

<p>
"And the sentence of the court will be, dismissal
from her presence for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Have some mercy on him," said Mabel.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to know the duties of an aide-de-camp,"
said Audley, not ill-pleased to find himself
an object of interest to two such handsome girls.
</p>

<p>
"Of papa's at least," said Rose: "to revise the
dinner and visiting lists; to see Mab and me to
and from all balls, kettle-drums, reviews, durbars,
and so forth; to arrange picnics; to do all the
squiring and shawling business, and to dance with
us whenever we feel bored by some slow griff who
can't keep time; to make bets of gloves, fans, and
bouquets, and to lose them so nicely and so opportunely,
that the payment thereof appears a veritable
glory; to see us through the crush of the supper,
and procure ices, creams, chicken, champagne, and
crackers, no matter how the thermometer may stand,
or how weary the punkahwallah may be&mdash;all of
which are among the duties of an accomplished
staff-officer."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Rose, how your tongue runs on!" said
Mabel.
</p>

<p>
"Poor fellow, I must spare him, for his heart
seems divided between the mother and daughter; so
I hope that this Captain Devereaux may soon be
home, lest evil happen.  But here we are at
Bodmin!" she added, as the carriage, after quitting
the highlands of granite and dreary moorland which
extend to within four miles of the ancient assize
town, rolled through its centre street.
</p>

<p>
"And now, if you choose," said Mabel, "Trevelyan,
you may enjoy the indispensable cigar while
we investigate the industrial treasures of a country
draper's shop.  We have but one hour to spare, and
then homeward."
</p>

<p>
"Or we shall have papa consulting that remarkable
watch, which he got from Sir John Keane
after the storming of Ghuznee," added Rose, as
disdaining Audley's proffered hand, she sprang
lightly from the carriage steps.
</p>

<p>
So, for a time he was left to "do" the lions of
Bodmin, the handsome old Norman church, the
few pointed arches and dilapidated walls of the
Leper Hospital, and so forth; and to his own
reflections and thoughts, which, heedless of the
sharp banter he had undergone, were all of Sybil&mdash;at
that very moment struggling back into perfect
consciousness from feverish delirium, and stealing
from Winny Braddon the visiting-card he had
recently left, that she might conceal it under her
pillow.
</p>

<p>
To her, he was fast becoming the realisation of
all her day-dreams&mdash;"the one moving spirit that
animated the whole world of her united romances."
He was,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"her first and passionate love, that all<br />
  Which Eve hath left her daughters since her fall."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To Rose and to Mabel Trecarrel, he was simply
one among the many "nice fellows" they had met
with in society, and should meet again in plenty.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
HE LOVES ME, TRULY!
</h3>

<p>
To Audley's mind there was a freshness and innocence
about Sybil, that made her image dwell in his
heart prominently, and more vividly than the
dashing and showy Mabel and Rose Trecarrel
could have conceived to be possible.  Moreover,
there was, to him, something glorious in the
conviction that for the sake of this lovely young girl he
had confronted a manifest peril; that by doing so
he had saved her and established&mdash;as he hoped&mdash;a
tie of no ordinary strength and peculiarity between
them, linking, in the future, their histories if not
their lives together; for to him she owned now, most
probably, the fact that she existed at all.
</p>

<p>
Such were the kind of thoughts to which
Trevelyan, hitherto a heedless and pleasure-loving
young subaltern of Hussars, indulged in many a
dreamy hour, even when half flirting or "chaffing"
with the Trecarrels, riding or driving abroad with
them, turning the leaves at the piano while Rose
displayed the perfection of her white shoulders and
taper arms after dinner, and dawdled languidly over
the airs of Verdi and Balfe; and to which he fully
abandoned himself, when he strolled forth alone,
to enjoy a cigar in the lawn or in some secluded lane.
</p>

<p>
Sybil on her part deemed it equally delightful, to
think that she owed her life to him; for had not
Audley and others said (and she felt the truth of
it) that, ere the ebb of the tide should have left the
lower end of the cavern open and free, she must
have perished of cold or terror, or both.
</p>

<p>
She had read the contents of many a box from
"Mudie's," but no episode in any of the three
volumes octavo therein seemed exactly to resemble
hers in the Pixies' Hole.  It was very romantic and
strange, no doubt; but to Constance it appeared
that the still concealed part of their relationship
was the most strange and romantic feature in the
affair.
</p>

<p>
Like most, if not all, young girls, she had read all
about love in novels and romances; she had talked
about love to school-companions, some of them
enthusiastic Italian girls at Como, by the Arno, and
elsewhere; and now a lover had actually come, one
who on three successive days had left cards, with
earnest inquiries concerning her health and that of
her mamma.
</p>

<p>
She remembered the endearment of his manner
when he saved her, but feared, at times, that such
might only have been caused by the peculiarity of
their situation; and then she would blush with
annoyance at herself, as she recalled the somewhat
too pointed way in which she questioned him about
Rose Trecarrel, to whom she was still a stranger,
and of whom she had thus evinced a jealousy&mdash;actually
a jealousy, as if thereby assuming a right to
question his actions!
</p>

<p>
But had he not called her Sybil, and said that he
loved her, and her only?
</p>

<p>
The afternoon of the fourth day saw Audley
Trevelyan&mdash;always careful of his costume, on this
occasion unusually so&mdash;passing slowly down the
willow avenue towards the villa; and as he
approached the latter, the beating of his heart
quickened on perceiving the light figure of Sybil
pass from the pillared portico into a conservatory
that adjoined the house.  So she was convalescent&mdash;had
recovered at last; and now he would speak
with her alone, and might resume perhaps the
thread of that hurried but delightful topic, which
was so suddenly cut short on the evening he saved
her, by the voice of the impatient General.
</p>

<p>
He approached the glass door of the conservatory,
which she had left invitingly open, his footsteps
being completely muffled by the soft and
close-clipped turf of the little lawn.
</p>

<p>
The conservatory was handsome, lofty, and
spacious, floored with brilliantly coloured encaustic
tiles, and constructed of iron, like a kiosk; its
shelves were laden with delicate ferns, with cacti
and gorgeous exotics in full bloom, though the
season was in the last days of autumn, and over all
drooped, almost from the roof to the ground, the
far-stretching and slender green sprays of a graceful
acacia.  Under this stood Sybil, clad in a simple
white dress, decorated by trimmings of rose-coloured
satin ribbon, and having a dainty little lace collar
round her slender neck; and Trevelyan watched her
in silence and with admiration for half a minute ere
he entered.
</p>

<p>
It was the freshness and girlish purity of Sybil
that charmed him quite as much as the delicacy of
her beauty.  During his few years of military life, in
London, at Bath, Brighton, and Canterbury, even at
Calcutta, he had met many such girls as the
Trecarrels&mdash;brilliant in flirtation and knowing in all
manner of arts and graces; but none that
resembled Sybil.
</p>

<p>
She had plucked a dwarf rose, and was about to
place it in the breast of her dress.  Suddenly she
seemed to pause and change her intention; for a
bright and fond smile spread over her soft little face,
and while speaking to herself, leaf by leaf, she began
to pluck the flower slowly to pieces.
</p>

<p>
She spoke aloud, but her voice was so low that it
failed to reach the ears of Trevelyan, till after a
time, when, as the leaves lessened in number, she
began to raise her tones, and her occupation became
plain to him.  She was acting to herself&mdash;repeating
the little part of Goethe's Marguerite in the garden,
but in a fashion of her own.
</p>

<p>
"He loves me a little&mdash;tenderly&mdash;truly&mdash;he loves
me not!"
</p>

<p>
With each pause in this floral formula, the old
German mode of divination in love affairs, a pink
leaf floated away or fell on her white dress; and when
but seven remained round the calyx, she paused for
a moment; her face brightened as the charm seemed
to work satisfactorily; she resumed her plucking,
and as the seventh or last leaf was twitched from
the stem, she clasped her hands and exclaimed with
joy&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Truly&mdash;Audley loves me <i>truly</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Her colour deepened, and there was almost a
divine expression about her eyes and lips; but she
became covered with intense confusion when
Trevelyan approached her suddenly, and said with a
tender and pleasantly modulated voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Your floral spell has worked to admiration, for
Audley does love you truly and fondly, dearest
Sybil!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Trevelyan&mdash;and you have overheard
my folly!" was all she could falter out, as he
captured her hands in his own, and she stooped her
face aside.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mr.</i> Trevelyan?  Why, a moment ago you
called me plain Audley, and it did sound so
delightful!  Pray do not let us go back in our
relations.  And you have quite recovered, I hope,
from the effects of that frightful affair?" he added,
while smiling with fondness into the clear bright
eyes that drooped beneath his gaze.
</p>

<p>
"It seems as nothing, now&mdash;save when I dream;
you make too much of it&mdash;indeed you do," blundered
Sybil.
</p>

<p>
"Can I do so of aught in which you have a part?"
</p>

<p>
"Poor mamma is still in a weak and nervous
state; so, I am sorry to say, she will be unable to
see you."
</p>

<p>
As it was not "mamma" he had come exactly to
visit, Audley could only murmur some well-bred
expression of regret.
</p>

<p>
"How very remarkable that you should have
been there to save me!" said Sybil, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"The coldly treated stranger by the moorland
tarn, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"You forget that we had not been introduced, or
how came it all to pass?" she asked, with growing
confusion.
</p>

<p>
"As all things in this life do, dearest Sybil."
</p>

<p>
"But how?"
</p>

<p>
"It was fate&mdash;destiny."
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;are you a fatalist?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope not; and yet it were sweet to think that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?" murmured Sybil, her long lashes
drooping beneath the ardour of his glance, while
his clasp seemed to tighten on her slender fingers.
</p>

<p>
Much more passed that has been said, over and
over again, under the same circumstances, by every
pair of lovers since roses grew in Eden (and,
unluckily, apples too); and there were long pauses,
that were only pauses of the tongue, and which
beatings of the heart filled up, with many a sigh
"the deeper for suppression."  There grew between
these two a sudden sense of great trust which
increased the tenderness of their sentiments, while
deep gratitude was mingled now with Sybil's former
budding love.  It did seem to her, as if Fate had
deliberately cast each in the path of the other; and
doubtless it was so, for "out of these chance-affinities
grow sometimes the passion of a life, and
sometimes the disappointments that embitter
existence."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Audley, without mamma's consent, dare I
accept so lovely a ring?" said Sybil, in a low voice,
as she lingered at the conservatory door and contemplated
a jewel which Trevelyan had just slipped upon
her engaged finger.
</p>

<p>
"You will surely wear it for my sake, till&mdash;till&mdash;"
he paused, and scarcely knew what to say, for he
now began to reflect that he was only a subaltern,
and had been "going the pace," in his love-making,
with a vengeance!  To fall in love and engage
oneself were easy enough; but, as yet, he did not quite
see the end of the affair.  Sybil was, moreover, the
daughter of an officer whose temper, perhaps, might
not brook trifling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is an exquisite diamond!" resumed the
girl, the pause unnoticed, and its cause, to her,
unknown.
</p>

<p>
"It formed one of the eyes of Vishnu, a Hindoo
idol, in a temple near Agra.  One of the Cornish
Light Infantry&mdash;old Mike Treherne, the miner's
son&mdash;poked out both with his bayonet.  Jack Delamere
bought one; I the other, and had it set thus in a
ring by a Parsee jeweller in the Chandney Choke, at
a time when I little thought of having in mine so
dear a hand to place it on.  Has not our acquaintance
ripened with wonderful rapidity, darling??
</p>

<p>
"Under such terrible circumstances, I don't
wonder at it," said she, smiling tenderly as she
toyed with the ring, which was now enhanced in
value&mdash;priceless in her eyes, for it was a love-token.
</p>

<p>
A love-token! and what might be its future history,
and what their fate?  "Customs alter, and fashions
change," says a writer; "but love-gifts never grow
old-fashioned or out of date,&mdash;they are always fresh
from the golden age.  Old people die, and desks and
drawers are ransacked by their heirs.  Oh, take up
tenderly the withered petals, the lock of hair, the
quaint ring hidden away in some secret recess; for
hearts have once thrilled and eyes moistened at
their touch.  Precious gems and rare objects there
may be in casket and cabinet; but none preserved
with such jealous care as <i>these</i>, for they were the
gifts of love."
</p>

<p>
Sybil was a thoughtful girl, and even in that
happy hour a sadness stole through her heart, as
some such ideas occurred to her; but the young
officer thought only of the present time, of its joy
and of her beauty.
</p>

<p>
He pressed her to name a day when she and her
mamma, as by courtesy bound, would return the
visit of the Trecarrels; but, ere that could be
accomplished, there came to pass that "greater sorrow"
which the heart of Constance had foreboded, and
which must be duly recorded in its place; so the
hoped-for visit was never paid.
</p>

<p>
On this evening, Audley lingered long with Sybil.
Each had so much to say to the other, and so many
questions to ask, and so many fond plans for the
future, that parting was a difficult task, even with
the knowledge that they were to meet again on the
morrow.
</p>

<p>
It came; and noon saw him again at the villa,
where he was received in the drawing-room by
Constance alone; and to her he began to speak of Sybil
after a time, and to express his admiration and
regard for her.
</p>

<p>
This Constance had fully foreseen and expected;
but she was outwardly, to all appearance, collected
and calm, till the secret that oppressed her became
too much for her nervous system.  Thus, the tenor
of her bearing, which before had been all kindness
and gratitude, suddenly changed.  She became cold
and constrained, perplexed and even awkward; so
that a chill fell upon the heart of Audley, whose
nature, all unlike that of his father, was frank and
generous to a fault.  She curtly but gently told
him, that until the return of her husband she could
afford no permission for her daughter to receive
addresses; and soon after, full of deep mortification,
and dreading he knew not what, Audley Trevelyan
took his leave; and Constance, as she watched his
figure pass out of the avenue, burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Sybil, as her youngest-born, she had ever looked
upon as a species of child&mdash;called "<i>the</i> baby," when
long past babyhood; and now Sybil had a lover!
Awakened to the reality of this, the poor lonely
mother regarded this new phase of her daughter's
existence with a species of alarm that bordered on
terror.
</p>

<p>
"Would that Richard were home!" was her first
thought; "even Denzil's advice would be something
to me now, poor boy!"
</p>

<p>
Audley had barely entered the Trecarrels'
drawing-room, when Rose, who was reclining on a
fauteuil, with her rich brown hair beautifully dressed
by the hands of her Ayah, and who fancied herself
immersed in a novel, tossed it aside, for her clear
hazel eyes speedily detected the disturbed
expression of his face, and proceeded forthwith to quiz
him as usual about "the Devereaux girl," and his
intentions in that quarter; while Mabel, who was
seated at the piano, sang laughingly a verse of
"Wanted, a Wife," then a popular song, altering
certain words "to suit the occasion," as Rose said&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "As to fortune&mdash;of course, I have but my pay,<br />
  A sub with seven-and-sixpence a day,<br />
  And a pension beside&mdash;rather small, 'tis confest,<br />
  For a leg shot away in the action 'off Brest;'<br />
  For the loss of three fingers in fighting a chase,<br />
  And a terrible cut from a sword in my face.<br />
  But with all these defects, my nerves I must string,<br />
  To propose for Miss Devereaux&mdash;delicate thing!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Audley felt almost inclined to quarrel with his fair
friends.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease a fellow so, Rose," said he,
wearily; "I have no money&mdash;at least, little beyond
my pay; and have as much idea of marrying as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say that."
</p>

<p>
"You could ask this Sybil Devereaux?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;it would be easy as cribbage."
</p>

<p>
"And what would she say, think you?"
</p>

<p>
"As a sensible girl such as she seems to be&mdash;'wait.'"
</p>

<p>
"Which means, that she would take you in time
to come?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Unless something better turned up."
</p>

<p>
"Don't judge of her by yourself, Rose," he
retorted, laughing, to conceal his annoyance, which
was greatly increased when the General's butler,
just as Audley was ascending to his own room to
dress for dinner, handed him a letter on a silver
salver.
</p>

<p>
It was from his father; written in his usual clear
and precise hand.  Audley for a time left it on the
toilette table; then he tore it open, with an air of
irritation, as these paternal missives were rarely
pleasant ones, being always filled with advice, varied
by reprehension.
</p>

<p>
"Fathers have flinty hearts&mdash;and, by Jove, here
is one!" muttered Audley, while his brows contracted.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen in the public prints," ran the letter,
"all about your adventure with the daughter of
those strange people who live at Porthellick.  The
woman Devereaux is, as her name imports, too
probably some designing French adventuress.  Mabel
Trecarrel has written to your sister Gartha, that
you are quite smitten with the daughter; but I give
you my distinct advice and notice to take heed of
what you are about, and to join us in London
without delay.  You left the Hussars, even in India,
because of the expense of the corps, neither tentage
nor loot" (loot! the governor means batta) "being
sufficient to maintain you.  Disobey me in the
matter of this girl Devereaux, and <i>I shall cut off</i>
even the slender allowance I promised you, for the
Cornish Light Infantry."
</p>

<p>
Audley crushed up the letter in his hand, for it
came, at that particular moment, like a sentence of
death.
</p>

<p>
And Downie Trevelyan could write thus of the
loving and amiable little family circle at the villa,
knowing all he did, and suspecting more!
</p>

<p>
To fear, or to find that his brother Richard, so
long deemed an eccentric bachelor, had a family
ready made and at hand to succeed him in the
honours of Rhoscadzhel and Lamorna was bad
enough.  These interlopers who came between his
own family and the line of Trevelyan might (perhaps)
be set aside; but to find that his eldest son
had become entangled with one of those so-called
Devereaux, proved too much for the equanimity of
the far-seeing lawyer.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE GREATER SORROW.
</h3>

<p>
At the very time when Mabel Trecarrel was
singing to tease Audley, Sybil was beginning a song
of a very different character and calibre to soothe or
amuse her mamma.  It was a grand old Hungarian
ballad, with an accompaniment like a crash of
trumpets at times; and was one she had picked up
during their wanderings on the banks of the Danube;
but she had only got the length of the first two
verses, when her mother's tears arrested her.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Was it the vine with clusters bright<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That clung round Buda's stateliest tower?<br />
  No, 'twas a lady fair and white,<br />
  Who hung around an armed knight;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was their sad, their parting hour.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "They had been wedded in their youth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together they had spent life's bloom;<br />
  That hearts so long entwined by truth<br />
  Asunder should be torn in ruth&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a cruel and boding doom!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Oh cease, Sybil," said Constance; "cease; it
was your papa's favourite."
</p>

<p>
"Then why cease, mamma?"
</p>

<p>
"He is not here, and I feel I know not what&mdash;a
foreboding&mdash;a superstition of the heart."
</p>

<p>
So Sybil closed her piano, and it was long, long
ere she opened it again.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks had now elapsed since the Montreal
steamer <i>Admiral</i> (his anticipated departure by which
Richard Trevelyan fully notified to Constance) had
been due at Blackwall, and yet there were no tidings
of her, so insurances went up, and underwriters
looked grave.  No Atlantic cables had been laid
as yet between Britain and America, though such
things were talked of as being barely possible.  The
next steamer announced that the <i>Admiral</i> had duly
sailed at her stated time; so, save the letter which
contained the pleasant odds and ends concerning
Montreal and their early lover days, poor Constance
saw her husband's writing no more.
</p>

<p>
Her surmises were endless, and the worthy rector
lent his inventive aid to add to them.  Might not
the ship have met with some accident to her engines,
and put back slowly under canvas to Montreal, the
Azores, or elsewhere?
</p>

<p>
Lost&mdash;was the word that hovered on her lips and
trembled in her heart&mdash;LOST!  Oh, that was not to
be thought of.  Yet if it were so, some must have
survived to tell the terrible story; some might have
been picked up, famished and weary, by a passing
ship, and taken perhaps to a distant region, Heaven
alone knew where.  Such events happened every day
on the mighty world of waters; so as week
succeeded week, the familiarity with suspense, sorrow
and horror seemed to become greater; till ideas
began to confirm themselves, and probabilities to be
steadily faced, that she would have shrunk from in
utter woe but a month before!
</p>

<p>
Then came those cruel and shadowy rumours, by
which the public are usually tantalised, and the
relatives of the missing are tortured&mdash;stories of
wrecks passed, steamers abandoned&mdash;the masts gone,
funnel standing, and so forth, in this, that or the
other latitude; but all vague and never verified.
How many stately ships have perished at sea, of
which such stories have been told!  In those days,
it was the <i>President</i>, the great, "the lost Atlantic
steamer," on the fate of which at least one novel and
several dramas and songs have been written; and
but lately it was the turret ship <i>Captain</i>, with her
five hundred picked British seamen, that went down
into the deep, a few loose spars alone remaining to
tell of their sorrowful fate.
</p>

<p>
Constance and her daughter were inspired by
successive hope that he might have survived, and
fear that he had perished&mdash;too surely perished; and
these alternations were agony, for "the promises of
Hope are sweeter than roses in the bud, and far
more flattering to expectation; but the threatenings
of Fear are a terror to the heart."
</p>

<p>
At last there came a fatal day, when a passage cut
from a London newspaper was enclosed to Constance
by Audley Trevelyan, who had been constrained to
visit and remain in town with his family.
</p>

<p>
It contained distinct details of the total wreck of
the <i>Admiral</i>, which had foundered in a gale.  She
had been heavily pooped by successive seas, and
had gone down with all on board, save the watch on
deck, who had effected their escape in one of the
quarter-boats, and been picked up in a most
exhausted state, by one of Her Majesty's ships.  All
the passengers had been drowned in their cabins,
and to this account a list of their names was
appended.
</p>

<p>
"It is very remarkable, my dear madam," wrote
the unconscious Audley, "that I do not find the
name of Captain Devereaux borne in this list;
though we have all the sorrow to see that of my
uncle Richard, Lord Lamorna, whose American
trip has been to us all a source of mystery."
</p>

<p>
Constance read the printed list with staring stony
eyes, and a heart that stood still!
</p>

<p>
Mr. Downie Trevelyan had perused it carefully
too, with the aid of his gold double-eye-glass, and
an unfathomable smile had spread over his sleek
legal visage while he did so.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my husband&mdash;my Richard&mdash;so innocent
and true!  Gone&mdash;gone, and your children and I
are left&mdash;doomed to shame and sorrow&mdash;doomed&mdash;doomed!"
wailed Constance in a piercing voice, as
with her fingers interlaced across her face she cast
herself upon a sofa in despair.
</p>

<p>
"Mamma," urged the terrified Sybil, "what <i>do</i>
you mean?  Does not dear Audley write that papa's
name is <i>not</i> in the list; so he cannot have sailed in
that unhappy ship."
</p>

<p>
"My poor child, you know not what you say,"
moaned Constance, without looking or altering her
position, for dark and bitter was the desolation of
the heart which fell on her.
</p>

<p>
In vain did poor Sybil caress and hang over her
in utter bewilderment, and read and re-read Audley's
letter without being able to comprehend the agitation
of her mother, who answered nothing.  For the
time she was overwhelmed by the immensity of their
calamity&mdash;by gloom and speechless sorrow.
</p>

<p>
But one thought was ever present&mdash;there was a
face she should never more behold&mdash;a voice she
never more should hear; the great ship going down
in the dark; "the passengers drowned in their
cabins," by the furious midnight sea; and he who
loved her so well, who had crossed the Atlantic to
bring back the full and legal proofs of their nuptials,
was now in the shadowy land&mdash;the Promised
Land&mdash;where there are neither marriages nor giving
in marriage; and where there can be no graves
either in the soil or in the sea.
</p>

<p>
With this calamity must many others come!
</p>

<p>
Richard's means died with him; the proofs of her
marriage and of her children's position had perished
with him too.  Even the newspapers in their notices
of the event, were careful to record that "as Lord
Lamorna (who had so lately succeeded to that
ancient title) died a bachelor, he would be heired by
his brother, the eminent barrister, Mr. Downie
Trevelyan, now twelfth Lord Lamorna of Rhoscadzhel,
in the duchy of Cornwall."
</p>

<p>
There was the usual obituary notice in a popular
illustrated paper, with a wood-cut of the late lord's
arms, the demi-horse <i>argent</i> issuing from the sea,
the coronet, the wild cat, and the motto <i>Le jour
viendra</i>.
</p>

<p>
Even Derrick Braddon's name was recorded as
among the list of the drowned; so the sole surviving
witness of the hasty and secret marriage had
perished with his master.
</p>

<p>
Sybil had answered Audley's letter&mdash;Constance
was quite incapable of doing so&mdash;urging him
piteously, for the love he bore her, to make what
other inquiries he could at Lloyd's, the shipping
offices and elsewhere, as her mamma seemed to be
distracted; and promptly a reply came, but not in
Audley's handwriting, though it bore the London
post-mark.  It was addressed to her mamma, who
in a weak and breathless voice desired her to read
it; and great were the terror and perplexity of the
girl, when she perused the following sentence&mdash;for
one contained the whole matter.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"CHAMBERS, TEMPLE.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MADAM,
</p>

<p>
"A letter written by your daughter and
bearing the Porthellick postmark, has just fallen
into my hands; so I hereby beg to intimate to you
that my eldest son and heir, the Hon. Mr. Audley
Trevelyan, can hold no such intercourse as that
document would seem to import, or be on such
terms of intimacy with a young woman who is
destitute of position, who has not a shilling in the
world, and whose parentage, family, and so forth&mdash;you
cannot fail to understand me&mdash;are matters of
such extreme uncertainty, not to say worse; thus
you must endeavour to control her actions, as I
shall those of my son, who goes at once to join his
regiment in India.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "I am yours, &amp;c.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"LAMORNA.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"A copy kept."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"How dare this Lord Lamorna write to you thus,
mamma?" asked Sybil, her dark eyes flashing with
unusual light; but the pale mother answered only
with her tears, and recalling now certain broken
sentences which had escaped her&mdash;sentences that
seemed somewhat to correspond painfully with the
insulting tenor of the letter.  Sybil, after the first
hours of excessive grief were past, said in a
composed voice, yet with tremulous lips,
</p>

<p>
"What does Lord Lamorna mean?  Who are we,
mamma? and what are we?"
</p>

<p>
Constance was silent, though each pulsation of
her heart was a veritable pang.
</p>

<p>
"Are we not Devereaux?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Who then?" urged Sybil, her pallor increasing
while the silence or pause that ensued was painful
to both; to none more than the innocent mother,
the guarded secret of whose blameless life was now
about to be laid bare before her own child&mdash;a secret
that seemed now to assume the magnitude of a
crime!  All the care, doubt, anxiety, and mystery
of the past years had gone for nothing, and the
sacrifice she had made of herself, was now likely to
recoil fearfully upon her, and more than all upon
her children.
</p>

<p>
In broken accents, with her aching head reclined
on Sybil's breast, she told all that the reader already
knows; the insane pride of birth and family which
inspired the old lord, his suspicions and threats, the
long necessity for consequent secrecy; and Sybil
heard all this strange story with intense bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
Could she realise it&mdash;take it all into her
comprehension?  Her mother was a lady of title&mdash;her
brother Denzil was the real Lord Lamorna, she
herself was not a Devereaux, but a Trevelyan like
Audley&mdash;and he, Audley, who loved her so, was her
own cousin!
</p>

<p>
This revelation then explained all to Sybil; all
of their wanderings in strange places, and sudden
departures from them, when unwelcome tourists
who might have recognised Richard Trevelyan came,
their secluded life at Porthellick, their marked
avoidance of the Trecarrels and others, and on the
whole poor Sybil felt cut to the heart, and inspired
by not an atom of pride; yet she tenderly and fondly
embraced her mother with greater fervour than ever,
for more than ever did she feel that she must love
her now.
</p>

<p>
"My poor papa drowned&mdash;drowned, unburied in
the sea&mdash;passing away from us without even the
name by which we have known and loved him!"
exclaimed Sybil.  "Oh why is God so cruel to us?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas, Sybil, we can but adore the decrees of
Heaven, without seeking to know more of them.
This stroke is hard to bear, child&mdash;all the harder
that I have reason to fear&mdash;to dread, oh, my God,
that more than your papa's life has perished with him."
</p>

<p>
"More mamma; what can be more?"
</p>

<p>
"That which was dearer to him than life; the
succession of Denzil&mdash;the honour of us all!"
</p>

<p>
After a long pause, with a vague expression in
her eyes, as if her thoughts were travelling back
into the years of the past, Sybil said,
</p>

<p>
"I had begun to suspect there was some
unpleasant mystery about us."
</p>

<p>
"But affection and delicacy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Both, dearest mamma sealed my lips and I was
silent; but oh, to what good end or purpose has it
all been?  By this, too surely is Audley also lost
to me."
</p>

<p>
"My poor child, he was your lover, and through
me you think you lose him.  Oh pardon me, Sybil,
darling, for I, your hapless mother, am the cause
of all this!  Had your papa never seen, or known,
or loved me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not say so, mamma dear," whispered Sybil
as her mother's tremulous lips were pressed on her
throbbing brow.
</p>

<p>
"It was a plan your papa formed to save his
inheritance for you and Denzil, and already his
brother claims all."
</p>

<p>
"It was a false plan, and see how it may fail
us&mdash;nay already, to all appearance has failed us."
</p>

<p>
"He is in his grave&mdash;if indeed the ocean can
be called a grave."
</p>

<p>
"True, my darling papa&mdash;and I must not upbraid
him, even in thought."
</p>

<p>
"If it is the will of God that I should suffer, His
will be done!  But my children&mdash;my children!"
cried the widow wildly, and she raised her hands
and her dark and beautiful but bloodshot eyes to
Heaven; "my brave and handsome Denzil, and my
soft sweet Sybil, of what have they been guilty,
that shame and ruin, should fall on them?"
</p>

<p>
"Mamma," whispered Sybil, embracing her
closely, "we must learn to bear with resignation
the woes we cannot help.  But oh," added the girl
in her heart, "how am I to write to Denzil of all
this sorrow, and probably worse than sorrow and
poverty?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
A FAMILY GROUP.
</h3>

<p>
And so he was gone&mdash;this tender husband, who
had loved her so dearly, and whose secret she had
shared so unavailingly for years; and apart from
the horror of the doubt that hung over the future
of her children, whose means and honour, like her
own, had too probably perished with him, a despair
grew in the heart of Constance when she surveyed
the familiar objects, the little household gods of
their once happy home, and thought upon the days
that could never, never come again.
</p>

<p>
There were times when she could not believe
that she had lost him; that her sorrow was a
painful dream from which she must awake.  She
perpetually found herself softly whispering his name,
especially in the waking hours of the night.  Thus
too, from overtension of the nervous system, she
would start at the fancied sound of her own name,
uttered as if by his voice at a vast distance.
</p>

<p>
In the delicacy and tenderness of Constance,
there was an amount of keenness and intensity
possessed by few, and thus her heart bled for her
daughter, rather than for her own dubious position,
the fact of which had been so coarsely thrust upon
her by the insolent letter of Downie Trevelyan,
who was now formally spoken of and everywhere
announced and received as "Lord Lamorna."
</p>

<p>
That Sybil had given all the wealth of her young
heart to this man's son, was but too evident to her
anxious mother's observation; but how would
matters tend now, and could that misplaced love
have a successful termination?
</p>

<p>
Days were passing in sorrow now; no letters
from Audley came to either.  Sybil looked delicate
and grew pale and thin, for a double grief was
consuming her, and Constance began to marvel in
her heart, was she meant to live in suffering and
penury, perhaps to die early, this child&mdash;her dead
father's idol, so loved and petted by him.
</p>

<p>
Sybil felt secretly pleased with the idea that
there existed between her and Audley a tie&mdash;the
tie of blood&mdash;which even the antagonism of his
crafty father could not break.  "The idea of
cousinly intimacy to girls is undoubtedly pleasant,"
says Anthony Trollope; "and I do not know
whether it is not the fact, that the better and the
purer the girl, the sweeter and the pleasanter is the
idea."
</p>

<p>
How often had Constance asked of herself&mdash;but
never of him who was gone&mdash;"How long is this
deception to be carried on?  How long am I to
wait before I take my place in the world as the
wife of Richard Trevelyan, and cease to figure as
a sham Devereaux, and how long are our children
to be thus under a cloud?"  All obstacles were
removed now, but the sham was becoming a reality,
and the cloud was growing darker than ever.
</p>

<p>
And was her poor Denzil, then so far away from
her, to be tamely robbed of his noble inheritance
after all?
</p>

<p>
The necessity for action in some way, even before
acquainting him with his father's death and real
rank, compelled Constance to bestir herself.  She
knew no one whom she felt tempted to consult
with confidence, and was totally ignorant of the
line of action to adopt, but on hearing, before a
week had passed, that the whole family of the
Trevelyans had come from town and taken up their
residence at Rhoscadzhel, she resolved to lose no
time in confronting the usurper personalty, attended
only by her daughter.  She could&mdash;she feared not&mdash;fully
prove the identity of "Captain Devereaux" with
Captain Trevelyan the late lord, and her husband's
miniature, which she wore, and his letters, especially
the last from Montreal, would prove still further
the fact of her marriage, and his intentions as
regarded his will, though they were all addressed to
her as Mrs. Devereaux, and simply bore his
signature as "Richard," save one already mentioned,
to which he appended his title.
</p>

<p>
So she thought and flattered herself while,
clad in the deepest mourning, she and Sybil
traversed, by the Cornwall Railway, the forty odd
miles that lay between Porthellick and Rhoscadzhel,
followed by the prayers and blessings of old Winny
Braddon.
</p>

<p>
"That which we fancy must break our hearts,
we can bear patiently, and what is more, so learn to
conform to, that after a few years of life, we can
wonder that we thought them hardships," says a
writer with much truth.  So did Constance think
her heart would break, when all the reality of her
desolate condition was brought home to her, by
her mirror reflecting her face&mdash;the face that
Richard loved so well&mdash;encircled by a widow's
cap&mdash;that odious ruche of tulle; but she already felt
the conviction strongly, that whatever happened
now, she would not have many years of life before
her.
</p>

<p>
Mother and daughter sat silent and sad while the
train swept on, Lostwithiel with its antique octagon
spire and the ruins of Restormal, with their moat
full of sweet-briars; St. Blazey, to whose shrine
the woolcombers made their pilgrimages in the days
of old (the saint having been tortured or curried
to death with wool-combs, by the Cornish men who
declined to be converted from Druidism), with many
a spacious lawn and bare autumnal wood and many
a purple moor, were speedily left behind; and now
it was past Grampound with its market-house and
ancient granite cross, the train went screaming and
clanking.  Redruth next, in a dreary and barren
district whose wealth lies far below the soil, which
is literally honeycombed by the shafts and levels of
mines; and then came Hayle, the houses of which
are all built of scoria or slag, the debris of ancient
mines; and then the travellers hired at the "White
Hart," a carriage for Rhoscadzhel.
</p>

<p>
To Constance, the scenery there had its chief
interest in the circumstance that in youth and
manhood her husband must have been familiar with
every feature of it, and must have shot and hunted
over it all.  Noon was past now; but the sun shed
a rich golden light upon a calm sea, of which they
had lovely glimpses at times between the grey
granite <i>carns</i> and clumps of oak and elm.  Sometimes
the carriage rolled past wildernesses of rock
and morass, where wild tarns reflected in their glassy
depths the blue sky above, and where valleys opened
westward to the Bristol Channel, whose waves were
buttressed out by precipices of bold and striking
outline, and the heart of Constance began to beat
painfully as each revolution of the wheels drew her
nearer and nearer to the house, that long ere this
should have been her home.
</p>

<p>
She felt, or thought, that now she was about to
face, confront, and grapple with her fate, and to
know the best or worst!  The secret burden so long
intolerable, would now be cast aside, and the
adoption of any line of action, in lieu of the existence
she had led since her loss was confirmed&mdash;the dumb
mechanical life of one too paralysed even to think&mdash;was
a relief.  Yet moments there were when she
half repented of her journey.
</p>

<p>
Her husband, her sole protector, was gone, and
the proofs of their marriage, and of his intentions
by will, too, were gone also!  If her arguments were
repelled, her assertions denied, what must be her
fate, and how terribly should she and those he
loved so well be exposed to the sneers and
heartlessness of a world that knew nothing of their
good qualities, or of the cause for that concealment
which might now prove the cause of their
destruction.
</p>

<p>
What if even now, at the eleventh hour, as it were,
she turned prudently back, and concealed the fact
that she was the true Lady Lamorna&mdash;that her son
was a peer of the realm&mdash;and let him and Sybil pass
through life as humble Devereaux, content to earn
their bread as best they could?  But to see Downie
Trevelyan, the author of that harsh and most insulting
letter, occupying the place of her Denzil&mdash;no&mdash;no! a
thousand times no!
</p>

<p>
Some such fears had been occurring to Sybil, who
now said, in a low voice, as they drew near the stately
gate of Rhoscadzhel,
</p>

<p>
"I doubt, dearest mamma, whether this is a wise
proceeding on our part; if we have the legal right
to call ourselves Trevelyans, that right should be
placed for proof in legal hands."
</p>

<p>
"If we have&mdash;" began Constance, impetuously,
and then became silent, for she felt that the
views of her daughter were, perhaps, the most
correct.
</p>

<p>
The elaborate iron gate, and its tall granite pillars,
each supporting a grotesque <i>Koithgath</i>, surmounted
by a coronet, were left behind, and they proceeded
along the stately avenue by which we have so lately
seen Richard passing as chief mourner at the funeral
of the old lord; and now, as the porte-coch√®re (which
bore a double hatchment) was approached, came a
new perplexity to the mind of Constance.  How was
she to announce herself?
</p>

<p>
As "Lady Lamorna," where there was already one
who called herself so; simply as "Mrs. Devereaux,"
or as "a lady wishing an interview with Lord
Lamorna"?  But from the utterance of his name in
this instance she shrunk.
</p>

<p>
The pampered servants, on seeing that the
approaching vehicle was only a carriage hired from the
neighbouring inn, and not an equipage having coats
of arms and showy liveries, were somewhat slow
in answering the summons at the bell; but as
the hall door stood open, and, luckily for the
perplexed Constance, Mr. Jasper Funnel, the solemn,
portly, and intensely respectable-looking butler,
was lingering there, she asked if she could "see
his master."
</p>

<p>
Now this was a mode to which Mr. Jasper Funnel
was all unused, and he might have been disposed to
summon "Jeames" or "Chawles" to attend to her;
but there was now a hauteur in the bearing of
Constance that thoroughly bewildered, if it failed to awe
him.
</p>

<p>
"Master, mum?" he stammered; "his lordship
is at home, but engaged with General Trecarrel&mdash;I
can take in your card, however."
</p>

<p>
"I have not my card-case with me."
</p>

<p>
"What name, then?"
</p>

<p>
"It matters not&mdash;just say&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, mum, relations of the family?"
suggested Funnel, perceiving the depth of mourning
worn by the two ladies.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;near relations, indeed," replied Constance,
restraining her tears with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
The man of bins and vintages, who thought he
knew the branches of the Trevelyan family through
all their ramifications, looked still more perplexed;
however, he said, with a still lower bow,
</p>

<p>
"This way, mum&mdash;please to follow me," and
desiring their driver to await them, Constance and
Sybil entered the mansion of Rhoscadzhel.
</p>

<p>
As if to tantalise them by a display of all they
were perhaps to lose, or had already lost for ever,
a valet, to whose care Mr. Funnel now consigned
them, conducted them by a somewhat circuitous
route, as all the suites of rooms were not in order,
the family having arrived unexpectedly from town.
</p>

<p>
Passing through the marble vestibule, an arch on
one side of which opened to a gay aviary, and one
on the other to the beautiful conservatory, they
entered a long and lofty corridor, where the soft
carpet muffled every foot-fall, and where were the
objects of <i>vertu</i>, accumulated by several generations
of Trevelyans; a veritable museum it seemed, of
glass cases filled with quaintly illuminated vellum
MSS., in fine old Roman bindings, red-edged and
clasped; old laces of Malines and Bruges; Chinese
ivory carvings, delicate as gossamer webs; Burmese
idols; Japanese cabinets, covered with flaming
dragons; Majolica vases, where rosy cupids, grotesque
tritons, nude nymphs, and shining dolphins, were all
grouped together; Delft hardware of odd designs;
Etruscan cups, cream-coloured or crimson, with
slender black demoniac figures thereon; medi√¶val
suits of armour; family portraits of dames in ruffs
and farthingales, and of past Trevelyans, all
well-wigged, cuirassed, and armed: some with Bardolph
noses and paunches of comely curve, suggestive of
sack and venison; the chiefs of these being Lord
Henry, who was Governor of Rougemont Castle for
Queen Elizabeth, and Launcelot, the cavalier-lord,
who sought shelter in Trewoofe from the victorious
Roundheads.
</p>

<p>
The refined and cultivated taste of Constance
could well appreciate all these objects; but now, as
one in a dream, her eyes wandered over those walls
where many a gem of art was hanging; the soft-eyed
and white-skinned girls of Greuze; the bearded and
doubleted nobles of Vandyke; cattle, fat and
lazy-looking, by Cuyp; hazy sea-pieces by Turner, and
more than one lovely Raphael; but then her every
thought was turned inward; and as if to support
herself, she retained Sybil's tremulous little hand,
on which her clasp tightened, as the servant, who
was clad in mourning livery, with a black cord
aiguilette on each shoulder, opened noiselessly the
half of a folding-door, and ushered them into that
splendid library where her husband had found his
proud old uncle dead at the writing-table, and
Downie (with the unsigned deed) hanging over him,
with confusion and disappointment on his usually
stolid visage.
</p>

<p>
"Visitors, my lord," said the servant.
</p>

<p>
And to add to the perplexity of Constance, she
found herself face to face with the whole family
group&mdash;the whole, at least, save one, her nephew
Audley.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
HUMILIATION.
</h3>

<p>
The statements made to Audley Trevelyan by
his father as to the dubious position of the two
ladies at Porthellick&mdash;artful statements which
seemed, without collusion, to corroborate so much
that Mabel and Rose Trecarrel hinted or openly
advanced&mdash;had seriously grieved and perplexed him.
Thus, while loving Sybil and longing for her society
on one hand, with the selfishness or vacillation
peculiar to many young men, on the other, he began
to wish that he had not gone quite so far&mdash;that he
had been less precipitate in his love-making; but his
perplexity increased to utter bewilderment, not
unmixed with indignation, when his usually languid
mother, with considerable scorn and irritation of
manner, informed him that "the person calling
herself Mrs. Devereaux" was but an <i>intriguante</i>, who
had sought to lure his foolish uncle Richard into
marriage; and his father admitted that he and
others had long suspected his brother of having
some low and illicit entanglement.
</p>

<p>
Now Audley knew that this "<i>intriguante</i>" had a
son, whose existence might endanger his own
succession to a title.
</p>

<p>
Was this fair, slender and delicate girl, whose
gentle image had wound itself about the heart of
Audley, and on whose "engagement finger" he had
so recently slipped a ring, actually a cousin; but
one whom he could not acknowledge&mdash;a person
whom he dared not marry, in dread of that
trumpet-tongued bugbear called "Society"?
</p>

<p>
He had ceased for some days to write to her.  In
this he accused himself of gross selfishness; but his
father's open threats of withdrawing every shilling
of his allowance, of turning his back upon him for
ever, and so forth, if he dared to countenance the
Devereaux in any way; and his total inability to
live anywhere on his subaltern's pay alone, together
with the dread of compromising his cold, proud, and
intensely aristocratic mother and sister&mdash;in fact, it
would seem, his whole family too&mdash;made him strive
to crush in his heart the young love it was so sweet
to brood upon; but Audley strove in vain, and began
to think that the sooner he was back to India the
better for all.
</p>

<p>
He had been nervous, irritable, and "out of sorts"
since he had returned to Rhoscadzhel, and obtaining
a passing glimpse of the little white villa as the
train passed it, en route, had made him worse.  He
had procured Champagne and various other vintages
too freely from Jasper Funnel; he had broken the
knees of a favourite horse; ripped up the green
cloth of the new billiard table when practising alone,
and more than once had angrily laid his whip across
the back of unoffending Rajah.
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the visit which closes the
preceding chapter, his mother who was seated
languidly in a deep easy chair near the library fire,
playing with a feather fan, while her daintily slippered
little feet rested on a velvet tabourette, said in
her soft and monotonous voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I do wish, Audley, that odious dog of yours was
dead&mdash;shot or lost."
</p>

<p>
"Why, mother, it was poor Jack Delamere's
dying legacy."
</p>

<p>
"It is such a shaggy, self-willed, huge and savage
animal&mdash;always about one's skirts or in one's way."
</p>

<p>
"You are unusually energetic in your adjectives
this evening, my lady mother," replied Audley;
"poor Rajah is as gentle as a lamb, and I might
have found a kind owner for him ere this, however,"
he added, as he thought sadly of the winning Sybil
on whose skirts his splendid pet had been permitted
to nestle unrebuked.
</p>

<p>
"Visitors, mamma!" exclaimed Gartha Trevelyan,
a fair-haired and languid edition of her mother, and
already, in her sixteenth year, the imitator of all her
tones and ways; "who can they be&mdash;in a hired carriage, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Ladies in deep mourning," said General Trecarrel,
glancing uneasily at Audley.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" muttered the latter, growing quite
pale, as he recognised them from a bay window, and
at once quitting the library, descended by a private
staircase to where his horse and groom happened to
be awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
"My cousin&mdash;he is my own cousin; this was the
secret sympathy&mdash;the tie of blood that drew us to
each other," Sybil was thinking softly, in her timid
heart, to keep her courage up, at the very time when
he who, without flinching, would have faced a Sikh
gun-battery, or a horde of Afghans, was avoiding
her, and galloping ingloriously away from what he
deemed "a scene&mdash;a deuced family row," with a
blush on his cheek, shame, pity, and anger mingling
in his soul, with the half-formed wish that he had
never met and never known her!
</p>

<p>
Advancing into the room, the mother and daughter
bowed, and then stood irresolute.  The former had
expected to have seen Downie alone; but finding
him thus, amid his family, and the General present
too, all her pre-arranged and carefully considered
explanations and remarks completely fled her
memory, and her mind became blank as a sheet of
unwritten paper, as Downie, after a rapid whisper
to his wife, over whose colourless face there flashed
a look of angry scorn, took the initiative.
</p>

<p>
His wife, with her everlasting smelling-bottle or
vinaigrette and lace handkerchief; her newly-cut
novel close by; her pale, dull eyes and unmeaning
smile; her "company manners;" her soft white
hands, smooth and unwrinkled as her forehead, yet
cold and puerile as her heart, was always a kind of
bore; but now her <i>tout-ensemble</i> had all the impress
of insipidity, animated by insolence; for weak though
the lawyer's wife was in character, she felt that she
was mistress of the situation; and at least <i>pro tem.</i>,
if not for life, Lady Lamorna.
</p>

<p>
She regarded the widow with a cold and supercilious
stare, to which the former replied by a
steady gaze, and each seemed to draw her
conclusions of the other in an instant, for "to women
alone pertains that marvellous freemasonry, which
sees the character at a glance, and investigates the
sincerity of a disposition or the value of a lace
flounce with the same practised facility."
</p>

<p>
Downie, too, had his own peculiar acuteness and
instincts, sharp and keen, wherever he went; he saw
everything in a moment; whoever he met, he read
their faces like a book, he marked all their features,
deduced their personal characters, just as if he had
been intimate with them for a life-time; and a very
useful power this had proved to him, in the course
of his legal career; and now, in his mourning suit,
he looked like "one of those great crows that are to
be seen, apparently asleep, in a meadow in autumn;
but which, nevertheless, see everything that is going
on around them."  The gentle aspect, the forlorn
bearing, and uncommon beauty of Constance and
her daughter, would have softened any other heart
than Downie's; but his was like Cornish granite&mdash;the
oldest and stoniest of all stones.
</p>

<p>
General Trecarrel&mdash;somewhat nervously it must
be owned&mdash;shook hands with the intruders, for as
such they felt themselves viewed; but the dog,
Rajah, alone gave them a welcome by fawning round
Sybil, who trembled excessively, and could scarcely
restrain her tears, while the dog's recognition of her
did not escape the wife of Downie, who drew certain
conclusions therefrom.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Devereaux, I believe?" said Downie
Trevelyan, calmly, and with his professional smile, as
he looked up from the table, which was literally
heaped up with letters, many of them being
unopened; "to what do I owe the pleasure of this
visit?"
</p>

<p>
"You owe it to my sorrow, sir," replied Constance,
gathering courage, as her eye caught a portrait of
Richard Trevelyan, in his uniform, painted years
ago, ere he went to America, and looking just as she
had seen him in the early days of their happy
loverhood; and now the pictured face seemed to smile
upon her out of the past; "to the death of my
husband&mdash;your brother, as you know, by drowning,"
she added.
</p>

<p>
He gave her a stare of cold enquiry, over, and
finally, through his double gold eye-glass, which he
specially wiped for the occasion, and then turning to
his wife, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Gartha, my dear, take your namesake and the
boys with you&mdash;retire, please, for we may have much
to say that must not be said before you."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I&mdash;I too, am <i>de trop</i>?" said General
Trecarrel, a little nervously, assuming his hat and
malacca cane.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all&mdash;pray be seated," replied Downie.
</p>

<p>
"If&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; Mrs. Devereaux will excuse you,
General, I am sure," answered Downie, as his wife,
with her four younger children, sailed haughtily
from the room, drawing in her skirts as she passed
Constance, whose pretty lip only quivered a little
with disdain.
</p>

<p>
To do him justice, the barrister looked on the
widow with something of interest, mingling,
momentarily, with his fear and anger&mdash;but momentarily
only.  She was slenderly and so beautifully formed,
small featured, and dark haired, with much that was
intense and unfathomable in her pleading
eyes&mdash;pleading for her children's honour and her own:
and there was Sybil, too, clad in the deepest mourning,
her high black dress, with its pretty cuffs, and
a small white collar round her delicate neck, made
her fair skin seem fairer still, and appeared to
become the darkness of her hair and eyes better than
any other style of dress would have done; but, then,
Sybil looked charming in everything!
</p>

<p>
The little interest died, and Downie regarded
them with intense hostility, for he had all "that
sublime philosophy which teaches us to bear with
tranquillity the woes of others."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes," he said, after a most harassing
pause; "you are the lady who lives&mdash;in fact, who
has lived for some time past, in a villa near
Porthellick?"
</p>

<p>
"The same, sir."
</p>

<p>
Downie knit his brows, for she accorded him no
title, and he was somewhat jealous on the point.
</p>

<p>
"It was a bold act of my brother to bring you
here to Cornwall&mdash;a secluded place&mdash;almost under
the eyes of his own family too!"
</p>

<p>
"Circumstanced as we were by the eccentricity of
his late uncle, it was, perhaps, unwise," she replied,
gently.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad that you admit so much: a little villa
near St. John's Wood, or some such place, had been
more appropriate for persons so situated."
</p>

<p>
The eyes of Constance began to flash dangerously.
</p>

<p>
"My son is Lord Lamorna!" she exclaimed;
"and even on his cold-blooded uncle may punish
this cruel insult to his mother!"
</p>

<p>
The General, to whom all this revelation was new
and startling, began to feel uncomfortable, and to
look quite perplexed; but Downie only smiled a
crafty smile, as he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Pooh, my good woman, you are out of your
senses; what can be the object of this visit?  I am
busy&mdash;does your carriage wait?"
</p>

<p>
"Before scandals go forth in our name, I beseech
you to consider well, and to read this letter, which
will show you who I am and what I am, and why for
years we have all borne the name of Devereaux,"
said Constance, making a prodigious effort to control
her great grief and just indignation, as she held the
document before Downie; "it is the last my dear,
dear husband wrote me."
</p>

<p>
"Husband&mdash;absurd!  This is the wildest of wild
assertions," said Downie Trevelyan, as he took the
letter from her hand, nevertheless; and as he did so,
the words of her dead husband came back to her
memory, when he said "that proofs of their marriage,
beyond mere assertion, must be forthcoming;"
and now those proofs were buried in the sea.
</p>

<p>
"You must recognise the handwriting," said
Constance, in a tremulous tone; "and oh, sir," she
added, as she eyed him doubtfully and wistfully,
"you will restore it to me, and not destroy it?"
</p>

<p>
"Destroy!" said he, sternly; "what are you
talking about?  I hope I am too much of a lawyer
to destroy any document."
</p>

<p>
"Before witnesses, at least," was the awkward
addendum of the General.
</p>

<p>
Downie's legal eye quickly took in the situation,
as detailed by his brother Richard in that letter,
which stated that the little chapel of St. Mary, at
Montreal, had been burned down three years after
the regiment had left the city; that the P√®re Latour
and the acolyte were both dead; that though the
Registers had all perished in the flames, the signed
copy of the marriage certificate was preserved by
Latour's successor, and "is now in my possession,"
added the letter, the signature to which, "Lamorna,"
made the reader's eyes to gleam with secret rage;
but he merely said,
</p>

<p>
"Suppose this letter were written by my brother&mdash;a
supposition of which I do not admit the truth,&mdash;who
are 'those at home' whom he doubts?"
</p>

<p>
"You, most probably," said the General, with
soldierly candour.
</p>

<p>
"Absurd, my dear sir," replied Downie, tossing
the letter contemptuously to Constance.  "This is a
fabrication, written to suit the occasion: the church
burned; the Register destroyed; the witnesses dead,
too!  It is a strange story, and strange chapter of
accidents.  You lived with him long enough, I doubt
not, madam, to learn how to feign my brother's
handwriting.  This document has not even an
envelope&mdash;so where are the postal marks?"
</p>

<p>
"I lost it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  I thought so."
</p>

<p>
There was a peculiar basilisk flicker in the pale
eyes of Downie Trevelyan, and he surveyed the
shrinking widow of his brother pitilessly, with a
glance of hate&mdash;a glance beyond all the eloquence
of fury or wrath, for he felt in his heart&mdash;or what
passed for such&mdash;that she spoke truth in all this
matter, but a truth she would have difficulty in
proving.
</p>

<p>
"Oh mamma&mdash;mamma, let us go," implored Sybil.
</p>

<p>
"And this Dick Braddon who accompanied my
brother&mdash;the other witness&mdash;a worthless old Chelsea
pensioner, and so he too is gone?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone with my husband," replied Constance,
clasping her hands and looking upward.
</p>

<p>
"As my poor brother never yet, to my knowledge
at least, prior to his luckless American tour,
appended his name to any document as <i>Lamorna</i>, we
have no means of testing or comparing the signature
to your production, were such test necessary&mdash;which
it is not."
</p>

<p>
Gathering courage, Constance was about to make
some proud response, when Downie, in his (external)
character pure and unspotted as his shirt front, said
while turning to the General&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My brother Richard picked up, of course, some
of those dissipated habits which are peculiar to the
army, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pardon me, my lord," began the General, in
a deprecatory tone, while inserting his right hand in
the breast of his closely buttoned surtout.
</p>

<p>
"It is true, Trecarrel; you redcoats are a sad set,
and here we see the result of an unlucky liaison."
</p>

<p>
"Richard&mdash;Richard," wailed Constance, "how
hard is all this to bear!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madam," said Downie; "but the way of
transgressors is always hard."
</p>

<p>
"Transgressors, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Against the laws of morality and society, madam.
Do not misunderstand me, madam."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no&mdash;oh no," replied Constance, in a choking
voice; "I quite understand you."
</p>

<p>
The General was deeply moved; he advanced a
pace or two towards her, and lifted his hand with
an air of entreaty; but Downie was pitiless, and
added&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madam, and not content with seeking to
entrap my brother, there has actually been an attempt
made, too, to entrap and delude my son!"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said Constance, moving towards the door
of the library, "I came in hope&mdash;I must own,
half-desperate hope&mdash;of having an explanation from, or a
compromise with you&mdash;perhaps a recognition of our
just claims.  Assertion, even backed by such a
letter as this, is, I must own, but slender evidence;
so a court of law shall prove the rest."
</p>

<p>
"As you please, madam," replied Downie, rising
and ringing a hand-bell deliberately.  "Show
this&mdash;<i>lady</i> out.  So much for Mrs. Devereaux!" he added
furiously, for he was greatly disturbed and ruffled.
</p>

<p>
A mist seemed before the eyes of both mother
and daughter, as they quitted the stately room
mechanically, to seek their vehicle at the porte-coch√®re.
Constance kept her proud little head erect,
however, so long as she was under observation; for
though her heart was wrung with agony as she
thought of her children, there was something of a
Spartan matron in the outward bearing she affected,
and in her perfect power of self-mastery then.
</p>

<p>
Stared at in the corridor by the wondering and
mocking eyes of all the younger children of Downie,
who had taken their cue from the manner in which
their mamma had gathered her skirts in the library,
as if to avoid pollution; stared at too in the
vestibule and portal by Mr. Funnel the solemn Butler,
by Boxer the rubicund coachman, and by a group of
whiskered valets, who all saw that something, they
knew not what, "was hup," they reached the hired
carriage that was to take them back to Hayle; and
Jeames in powder, wearing "the uniform" of the
noble family, remarked to Chawles, a brother of the
plush and shoulder-knot, quite audibly, that "they
both seemed the lady, quite; but he feared they was
only a couple of guv'nesses or companions out of
place&mdash;a lot as miserable as curates and tutors, and
all that sort o' thing."
</p>

<p>
Constance shivered as if with ague when she
drew up the glasses of the carriage, and they took
their departure from Rhoscadzhel.
</p>

<p>
Open war alone could save or sink them now!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
"MRS. GRUNDY."
</h3>

<p>
General Trecarrel, who was an amiable and
well-disposed man, felt the utmost regret in having
been present at an interview so painful, unseemly,
and perplexing.  Notwithstanding the calmness,
dignity, and confidence with which Constance
asserted her claims to wifehood and nobility, he had
his secret doubts&mdash;which Downie had not&mdash;as to
the legality of the ties that had subsisted between
her and his late friend, Richard Trevelyan.  Yet he
could not but think of her kindly, humanely, and
with interest; she seemed so perfectly ladylike, was
so gentle and so beautiful.
</p>

<p>
In short, the old soldier, little given to study
character or matters not military, felt sorely bewildered
by the strange story so suddenly unfolded by his
fair neighbour, and withdrew to think over it and to
dress for dinner.
</p>

<p>
"So that odious woman and the cunning minx,
her daughter, are gone at last?" said Mrs. Downie&mdash;the
acknowledged Lady Lamorna&mdash;entering the
carpeted library, softly and noiselessly, in her usual
languid and wearied way.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Gartha&mdash;at last," replied her husband,
who was still seated at the writing-table with his
head resting on his left hand, for he was full of
thoughts that oppressed him.
</p>

<p>
"You look disturbed, Downie dear?" she lisped,
as she sank into her easy chair and resumed the
feather fan or hand screen.
</p>

<p>
"That idiot Audley has complicated matters by
forming an attachment for the woman's daughter;
but Trecarrel, who goes soon to India now, shall
take him off there at once."
</p>

<p>
"And what was the object of her visit, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she came here to try the favourite Whig
scheme&mdash;conciliation at any price, no matter how
humiliating; and exhibited a letter she had
manufactured, as from my brother; but it won't pass with
me&mdash;no, no!"
</p>

<p>
"You are right to repel such attempts as this;
and I agree with you that Audley had better relinquish
what remains of his leave and quit England,"
she replied, yet not without a sigh, for her son had
been but a short time at home, and India was so far
away.  But anything was better than that he should
entangle himself with a girl like this&mdash;her son
Audley, when she had almost registered a vow
"never to syllable a name unchronicled by Debrett;"
the idea was absurd, horrible in the extreme!
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, Downie dear," said she, after a little
consideration, "we are too fearful.  I have read
somewhere that 'boy and girl cousins never fraternise.'"
</p>

<p>
"Don't they, by Jove!" growled Downie; "especially
when they come to the age of puberty, without
having known each other previously.  Then the
Scots have a proverb about 'blood being thicker than
water,' though I can't see it in that way myself.  The
girl is remarkably handsome, and Audley's affair
with her must have made considerable progress ere
her letter came into my possession in London."
</p>

<p>
"Handsome? dear, dear! do you really think so?
I thought her very saucy in expression, and a positive
dowdy, in a dress made, no doubt, by some Penzance
milliner," replied the lady, while contemplating
complacently her own magnificent black <i>moire</i>, for she
did not entertain more charitable opinions
respecting the daughter than the mother.
</p>

<p>
Though more advanced in life than Constance
(for she had been married some years before her),
the wife of Downie had still considerable remains of
beauty, and, despite time and dimples turning fast
to wrinkles, she was bent upon being gay, young,
and beautiful still.  She had an air that decidedly
denoted high breeding, with much of languor and
indifference to all that passed around her.  She had
completely attained that bearing of placidity, utter
vacuity or unimpressionability, so sedulously affected
or adopted by many among the upper class of
English society, and even by their middle-class
imitators.  However, all the little spirit or energy
she ever possessed fired up now, in the conviction
that she was the Right Honourable Lady Lamorna,
that Audley was one of "England's Honourable
Misters," and that Gartha should find a husband
among the tufts and strawberry leaves at least.
</p>

<p>
Downie had not her ambition even in these
matters, but had naturally avarice; and his profession
had, of course, taught him trickery.  "Despair
of no man," it has been said: "there are touches of
kindness in natures the very roughest, that redeem
whole lives of harshness;" but to have sought for
charity or kindness at the hands of Downie were a
task as easy as taking a bone from a famished
tiger.
</p>

<p>
That day, at the dinner-table, after the ladies had
withdrawn, and Downie, the General, and Audley
were lingering over their wine (or wines rather), the
conversation naturally turned to the recent visit of
Constance and her daughter; and a painful theme it
proved to the young officer.
</p>

<p>
From General Trecarrel he had previously obtained
a narrative of all that had passed, and though
he thanked Heaven that he had been absent, his
heart was preyed upon by many keen and conflicting
emotions.  He loved Sybil tenderly, he acknowledged
to himself; but could he think of marriage
with her, when she was the daughter of a woman in
a position as dubious as that of Constance was now
openly declared to be&mdash;one, moreover, whose claims
were so startling, and whose allegations were, as his
father called them, so daring as to merit criminal
prosecution,&mdash;for so had the lawyer said in his wrath
and the strength of his own position!
</p>

<p>
Intense pity for the girl mingled with his passion
for her, and added to his great perplexity; and thus,
while his cheek alternately flushed and grew pale,
he sat with half-averted face, and the fingers of one
hand buried among his thick brown hair, irritated
by the conviction that his father's cold, keen, and
scrutinising eyes were bent loweringly upon him,
while in silence he heard the General bluntly
urging him "if he had any tender views in that
quarter, to get rid of them as soon as possible,
and be off to join his regiment;" for to Trecarrel
military service seemed a cure for every human ill.
</p>

<p>
"But the letter she showed you?" pled Audley.
</p>

<p>
"That letter, sir, I have already denounced as a
most daring forgery!" replied Downie, with as much
energy as his usually quiet manner permitted.
</p>

<p>
"Could she&mdash;one so eminently like a lady&mdash;be
guilty of such a crime?"
</p>

<p>
"Your uncle's mistress would be, of course,
familiar with his handwriting."
</p>

<p>
Audley felt his heart vibrate painfully at this
injurious but, as the circumstances seemed to stand,
not inapplicable term.  Compassion and tenderness
pleaded for the dove-eyed Sybil; but policy, society,
or the promptings of "Mrs. Grundy" urged that he
should, nay must, relinquish all thought of her for
ever; so while sitting there, sipping his
golden-tinted ch√¢teau yquem, and playing with the
embossed grape scissors, to all appearance very calm
and quiet, a storm of doubt and shame was struggling
in his heart with love; "for this passion," says
Lord Bacon, "hath its floods in the very times of
weakness, which are great prosperity and great
adversity, both which times kindle love and make
it more fervent."  And now Sybil was in an adversity
of which he knew not the actual depth.
</p>

<p>
"To me it seems that you are somewhat severe
in this whole affair, General," said he, after a
pause.
</p>

<p>
"God forgive me if I am so!" replied Trecarrel,
earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose this girl's position to be all you
advance, if we love because we like and admire
each other, are we to be censured?"
</p>

<p>
"Then who the devil should be censured?" said
his father, with asperity.
</p>

<p>
"Destiny."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" said Downie; "this is mere romance&mdash;mooning!"
</p>

<p>
"And deuced unlike one of the 14th Hussars,"
added Trecarrel.
</p>

<p>
"The very rubbish of which dramas are made."
</p>

<p>
"You are right, Downie; but, till now, I always
thought this young fellow of yours was rather fond
of my girl Rose."
</p>

<p>
Audley coloured deeply, and assisted himself to
wine, as he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I greatly admire both Miss Trecarrel and her
sister Miss Rose; but I have not the honour to
stand higher in their favour than that of others."
</p>

<p>
"But this girl Devereaux&mdash;&mdash;" his father was
beginning passionately.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, dear sir," interrupted Audley, "if I
beg that you will cease to taunt me on this painful
subject.  The tenor of the letter she wrote to
me&mdash;the letter which you found on my desk, and
which in all fairness you should not have read&mdash;a
Lieutenant of the Line not being exactly a
schoolboy&mdash;sufficiently evinced that we were on terms
of affection and intimacy.  I knew not then who
she was, or who her people were.  I had saved her
life, as the General knows, at considerable peril, and
so there grew a tender tie between us; but all shall
be ended now," he continued in a tone of emotion.
"I see that it must be so, sir.  I see also the
necessity for not compromising your just title to the
rank and place you hold by attaching myself in any
way to the fortunes of the Devereaux.  So I
implore you to let the matter cease, or I shall quit
the room&mdash;yes, even the house itself, so surely
as I shall ere long quit England, perhaps never to
return!"
</p>

<p>
"I thank you for this promise, Audley," said
Downie emphatically; "and when once with your
regiment, you shall find your allowance most amply
increased."
</p>

<p>
"For that I thank you, sir," said Audley, sighing.
</p>

<p>
"I am richer now than when you were in the
Hussars."
</p>

<p>
"And out of that wealth, Downie&mdash;I beg pardon,
I mean my Lord Lamorna&mdash;I trust you will do
something handsome now for poor Dick's widow
and orphan?" blundered the General.
</p>

<p>
"Widow and orphan!" repeated Downie, with
growing anger.
</p>

<p>
"Well, widow in one sense."
</p>

<p>
"In what sense?"
</p>

<p>
"A widow of the heart," persisted Trecarrel,
reddening to the roots of his grizzled hair.  "She
and her pretty daughter have suffered a fearful
stroke of fortune&mdash;and even poverty may not be the
most severe trial before them."
</p>

<p>
"I shall settle a small sum on the mother,
perhaps," said Downie, reluctantly; "and get the
girl, if you wish it, a situation as companion at
a distance from this."
</p>

<p>
"Companion?  That is a kind of upper servant
who must wash the spaniel, and feed the parrot,"
said the General, testily; "supervise the maid that
dresses her mistress's hair, read novels aloud, and
sermons on Sunday; write invitations, and answer
them; pay all bills, and stand all manner of
vapours and ill-humours, for thirty pounds per
annum and a <i>quiet home</i>!  Come, come, Downie,
d&mdash;n it," added Trecarrel, "you might do
something more handsome than that for a daughter
of Richard Trevelyan."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," replied the other, becoming slightly ruffled
by the old officer's perfect bluntness, "when certain
people in this world cannot get white bread and
wine, they should content them with brown bread
and water; they must also work, if they would not
beg.  I think that I shall have done enough if I do
what I propose for the daughter; and as for the
mother, through my humble endeavours, a housekeeper's
place or the matronage of a lunatic asylum
may be procured for her, if she is in poverty, and if
her want of previous character could be tided over
with the Board of Guardians.  By her daring claim,
she has certainly striven to injure me and all my
innocent family," added Downie loftily; "yet I do
not wish evil to happen to her."
</p>

<p>
"Whether we wish it or wish it not, neither will
come according to our mere human desire," retorted
the General; "so pass the Madeira, please, Audley,
for here comes Funnel with the coffee&mdash;a hint that
we are to join the ladies in the drawing-room."
</p>

<p>
Downie Trevelyan had always had his secret fears
of the family in the villa at Porthellick, and he knew
not exactly how strong their claims upon his dead
brother might be.  However, he had lost no time in
having himself fully served heir to the late lord, on
the loss of the steamer "Admiral" becoming an
ascertained fact; and, though a lawyer by profession,
he now literally loathed the sight of the circulars
and letters that poured in upon him on his accession
to rank and fortune.  There were legal details to be
filled up, dry formalities to be gone through with
perplexing repetitions and minuteness; there were
entreaties from tradesmen that "his Lordship would
not change the family custom," and applications of
a similar nature from town and country agents to
retain their agencies, &amp;c., &amp;c.  Then there was "the
suit of those Devereaux," as he called a bulky and
menacing document which a shabby-looking fellow
deposited at Rhoscadzhel one morning, with lists of
the vexatious papers required for the defence&mdash;all
the preparation of "some hedge-lawyer&mdash;some low
legal desperado," as Downie styled him; for he now
himself felt, in the tone and tenour of these legal
letters and documents, the pointed stings he had for
years past so pitilessly planted in others.
</p>

<p>
The legal document had the effect of completing
all the silent arguments of Mrs. Grundy in the
mind of Audley.  But a few days ago, he was so
happy in the conviction that he loved Sybil and was
beloved again; and now he saw the necessity for
action and resolution, and alike quitting her and
England.
</p>

<p>
He seated himself at his desk one evening for the
purpose of writing an explanatory or, if he could
achieve it, an exculpatory and farewell letter to
Sybil; but, after various attempts, he had got no
further than the date, when Mr. Jasper Funnel
entered the room, with a little sealed packet on a
silver salver.
</p>

<p>
It had just come in the household despatch-box
from Hayle, and bore the Porthellick postmark, so
he tore it open with trembling hands.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
A LEGAL "FRIEND."
</h3>

<p>
Constance never smiled again; yet in the presence
of Sybil she never gave way to the paroxysms
of passionate grief that came over her when she was
alone or in the seclusion of her own chamber.
Wealth and title, so long looked forward to in the
years that were gone, seemed alike most worthless
now, save that with the loss of these her children
lost their position in life, and herself her name and
honour!  Ever present was the idea, Oh that her
husband could look up from his grave, and see the
impending ruin and desolation of their once-happy
home! for, as we have already said, their means of
subsistence died with him.
</p>

<p>
And now, how were they to live?  The present
time was agony; the future dark and gloomy.
</p>

<p>
Paragraphs, the tenour of which proved intensely
annoying to Downie Trevelyan and all his family,
and which were painful and degrading to Constance
and Sybil (for such they felt them to be), began to
find their way into the local and even the London
papers, under exciting titles or headings, such as
"Singular Case of Presumption," or "Insanity,"
"The Cornish Widow again," "The Lamorna
Peerage," and so forth; and Messrs. Gorbelly and
Culverhole, as "his Lordship's solicitors," in
writing answers or contradictions to some of these
effusions, were but too happy, by such legal
advertisements, to mix their somewhat obscure and vulgar
names with the affair.
</p>

<p>
Audley read those insulting notices, assertions,
and contradictions with infinite sorrow and pain,
for then Sybil's pleading and upbraiding eyes would
come before him.  Through such uncourted publicity,
however, the mother and daughter began to
find themselves coldly viewed by neighbours now.
The rector ceased to come near the villa; the
village doctor whipped up his horse as he passed the
end of the willow avenue; and even the usually
friendly Trecarrels left for town&mdash;rumour said
correctly, for India&mdash;without paying another visit,
though perhaps, as theirs had never been returned,
they could not do otherwise.
</p>

<p>
All the charity and good they had performed, in
all the necessities relieved, all the ailments
alleviated, all the countless little kindnesses done, went
for nothing now; for the world is a malevolent and
censorious one; and that devilish maxim of Rochefoucauld,
that people feel a strange satisfaction in
the misfortunes of their best friends, was fully
exemplified.  Constance's new and startling
assertion of rank and position, however meekly done,
formed excellent food for the tongues of the
malicious and vulgar, who exist everywhere.  She had
to bear unjustly the contempt of many, the ridicule
of all; so that her pretty villa became daily less and
less a home.
</p>

<p>
From the tenour of that horrible interview at
Rhoscadzhel, where every word that passed seemed as if
burned into her heart with letters of fire, Sybil felt
a sure conviction that all must and should be at an
end between herself and Audley Trevelyan.  The
treatment of her mother, of her absent brother's
claims, of her own, and of her dead father's memory,
his will and wishes, all required this sacrifice at her
hands; so resolutely and calmly&mdash;though a few tears
rolled silently down her cheek the while&mdash;she drew
his diamond ring from her "engaged" finger&mdash;an
engaged one now no longer&mdash;and making it up in a
packet, together with a few letters he had written to
her, she despatched it, addressed by her own
trembling hand, and without a word of comment, to
Rhoscadzhel; and this packet it was which we have just
seen Jasper Funnel place in the hands of his excited
young master.
</p>

<p>
Her mother's embraces, tenderness, and kisses
were her sole but best reward for acting thus; yet
poor Sybil seemed the very impersonation of beauty,
grief, and girlhood bordering on womanhood.  The
buoyancy of the former was gone; a change had
come over her soft and once bright face, which wore
a sad and settled expression now.  It was that white
woe which someone styles "the deepest mourning
features can put on."
</p>

<p>
Her pencil and her piano, each so much the
solace of her lonely hours, were, of course,
relinquished now; and it seemed as if she should never
take to them again.  She looked ill, and appeared
to be pining: but, sooth to say, it was less the loss
of Audley than her mother's grief that affected her.
The doctor, when summoned, pocketed his guinea,
but did nothing more; so Winny Braddon urged
Constance, but in vain, that "their poor chealveen"
should be taken to the nearest <i>Mean-tol</i> (or Holed
Stone) so that she might try the sovereign old
Cornish cure for all mysterious ailments, by creeping
through the orifice thereof; for in the ancient
duchy, as in some parts of Ireland and the remote
Scottish Isles, where such natural or artificial
perforations were used of old by the Druids to initiate
and dedicate their children to the offices of rock-worship,
they are still regarded with superstition, as
possessing the gift of effecting miraculous cures.
</p>

<p>
Constance, too, was ill, and in the excess of her
grief and lowness of heart, she fancied herself worse
than she really was; and ever present was the
thought, how perilous the lonely path of life would
be to a girl so beautiful as Sybil, if she&mdash;her
mother&mdash;were taken away by the hand of death before
another and fitting protector were provided.  Morbid
at times by sorrow, this reflection made the breast of
Constance a prey to the most craving and clamorous
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
But a short time before, and their worldly prospects
had all been so different&mdash;so brilliant and
happy.  Now all was dark indeed!  When she
thought over all the baronial splendours of
Rhoscadzhel, and the many mementoes of her husband
which must be there, something of hatred for the
invaders of her children's patrimony and her own
marital rights began to mingle with her dull despair
of ever proving that she had the latter; and with all
her constitutional gentleness, when she recalled the
glance bestowed upon her by Mr. Trevelyan on
quitting the library, and the insinuations uttered by
Downie against her, in presence of General
Trecarrel, too, her blood boiled up within her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sybil!" she exclaimed one day, after sitting
long buried in thought, "some author says, 'there
are wild beasts in the human race;' and truly your
uncle Downie is one of these.  Can it be possible
that they had the same parents&mdash;he and your frank,
generous, and open-hearted papa?&mdash;that they share
the same blood, were nursed at the same breast,
and nestled together, as I have heard, in the same
little cot?"
</p>

<p>
Sybil was silent; she had, in this view of the
matter, but one secret and reclaiming thought.
Downie was Audley's father, and she would be
merciful.
</p>

<p>
But it was when inspired by one of those gusts
of indignation that Constance received, perhaps
unfortunately, a visitor&mdash;an attorney from a
neighbouring town&mdash;who stated that he had heard her
strange and painful story, and had come to make a
"friendly" offer of his legal services.
</p>

<p>
Now Mr. Sharkley&mdash;for such was his name&mdash;was
exactly, in many respects, what Downie, in his rage,
called him, and was an excellent specimen of
perhaps the most dangerous character in society&mdash;a
needy and unscrupulous lawyer.  He was attired
in rusty black garments, that seemed to have been
made for a much taller man.  The collar of his
swallow-tailed coat rose above the nape of his neck,
while the cuffs nearly reached to the points of his
fingers, and the legs of his trousers flapped loosely
over his instep.  He had a low projecting forehead
and keen eyes, the expression of which varied only
between intense cunning and the lowest suspicion.
His ears were enormous, set high upon his head;
and the right one, from being long used as a
pen-holder, projected from his skull more than the
left.  His features would have shocked Lavater,
while Gall and Spurzheim would have augured
the worst of his character by the development of
his head.
</p>

<p>
His legal practice&mdash;though Constance was in
blessed ignorance of the circumstance&mdash;was of the
lowest kind, and had seldom proved beneficial in a
monetary or any other sense to those for whom he
unluckily acted as agent; but the fellow could be,
when it suited him, suave, artful, and plausible
when he had a purpose to serve, and a relentless
bully when it was achieved; thus, seeing that though
little or nothing could be made of the present case
with the hope of success, much might be made of
it in the way of money, perhaps, of notoriety
certainly, and that in the end he might betray all
he knew to Downie Trevelyan for a consideration&mdash;with
these amiable views, he sought to worm
himself as a friend and legal volunteer into the
confidence of the otherwise friendless Constance.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sharkley heard her story attentively, and
committed it all to writing.  That her marriage had
been duly celebrated in a chapel at Montreal he
doubted not, nor the reason for keeping it so
secret&mdash;the absurd pride of old Lord Lamorna,
whose aristocratic prejudices were a local proverb
and hence her having, so unfortunately for her own
honour, passed so long under her maiden name of
Devereaux with her son and daughter.
</p>

<p>
But how was all this to be proved?
</p>

<p>
P√®re Latour was dead; the records of his chapel
had been burned in one of the many conflagrations
incident to the city; the certified extract from them
had perished in the sea with her husband.  Dick
Braddon too had been drowned, and the acolyte,
the other witness in the little French chapel, had
been long since laid under a wooden cross in the
little burial-ground that adjoined it.  A few letters
alone were not sufficient proof to upset in
England&mdash;whatever they might have done in Scotland&mdash;the
title and succession of a wealthy peer already
in possession; yet nevertheless Mr. Sharkley talked
about the instant institution of legal proceedings,
having the matter brought before a select
committee of privileges in the House of Lords, and so
forth, quite as confidently and as pompously as if
he was a Q.C. and high-class parliamentary lawyer;
and poor Constance felt a glow of hope for her
children's future rising in her heart, while he
compiled a narrative, took away the letters of her
husband, and, receiving in advance a handsome
sum for certain imaginary fees and expenses,
departed with nearly all the ready money she
possessed.
</p>

<p>
He really attempted, however, to get up a case
against "Lord Lamorna," and hence the bulky and
presumptuous document which exasperated Downie;
but from the weakness of her cause and the
character of her legal adviser it speedily fell to the
ground, only to fix a deeper stigma on the hapless
and innocent Constance.
</p>

<p>
Rumours of misfortune and mystery brought all
their creditors, now pretty numerous (for during
her husband's lifetime they had lived in good style
at the villa), down upon her in a pitiless horde.
</p>

<p>
Denzil, she knew, would now lose the liberal
allowance his father had promised him after leaving
Sandhurst on appointment; but with tentage, batta,
and other allowance, a subaltern can live on his pay
in India, when he might starve elsewhere.  In her
misery Constance gathered some comfort from this
knowledge, though ruin and penury&mdash;or work for
which they were both unfitted&mdash;were all that
remained to her and Sybil now.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
THE DOCTRINE OF CHANCES.
</h3>

<p>
And what of Audley, the lover, all this time?
</p>

<p>
He had written from Rhoscadzhel to Constance,
imploring her permission in moving terms to see
Sybil once again, and have some farewell explanation
with her, ere he departed to India, too probably
for years; for, with the usual inconsistency of the
human heart, no sooner did he find himself repelled,
than he felt the attraction towards her redoubled.
This letter had been addressed to Constance as
"Mrs. Devereaux;" and, without reflecting that he
could not bestow upon her a title already borne by
his own mother, she felt fresh anger at the
circumstance.  Without showing the missive to Sybil, who
conceived it might be on some legal business, she
cast it in the fire, and replied by an emphatic
refusal, adding that if he came near the villa,
which they were soon about to leave, her servant,
Winny Braddon (she had but one domestic now)
had received orders not to admit him.
</p>

<p>
Undeterred, he next wrote to Sybil, but this
effort proved equally unavailing.  Resolved not to
add to her mother's distress by any disobedience or
duplicity on her part, she showed her the letter
unopened; and it was at once re-addressed to
Rhoscadzhel, with the envelope unbroken, and
Audley flushed to the temples when it was placed
in his hand.
</p>

<p>
He felt himself to be still solemnly engaged to
Sybil, yet hopelessly separated from her, through
no fault of his own&mdash;separated without even a lovers'
quarrel.  He wondered now at the selfish thoughts
which more than once had occurred to him,
particularly on that day when he quitted the library,
and even the house, in such haste to avoid her, and
times there were when he blushed at the memory
of it.  Relations they were unquestionably by blood,
whether there had been a marriage or no marriage;
and this made Audley reflect all the more deeply
and tenderly on the subject of his severed ties with Sybil.
</p>

<p>
He wished to restore the ring to her in person,
to replace it on her finger as a memento of himself;
for the repossession of it made him restless and
uneasy, as the crazed Halfheller with his bottle-imp;
and if he was to do this, there was no time to
be lost, as he had but one day to spend in Cornwall
now.
</p>

<p>
The wild longing or craving to see her once
again, to have an explanation of some kind&mdash;he
knew not what&mdash;but beyond anything a letter could
contain (even were she permitted to receive it),
still inspired him, though prudence might have
suggested the utter inexpediency of further
interviews between them, circumstanced as they were.
Audley, however, was not of an age, neither was he
of the temperament, of one to play the part of
casuist.
</p>

<p>
"Why may I not baffle them all&mdash;this strange
mother, who can be so winning and yet is so
repellant, my cold and calculating father too&mdash;and
carry off the dear girl in defiance of all and
everything?  This very night I might do it," he
pondered: "the train in an hour or so would set me
down close by her; and if we make allowance for
human frailty and the 'doctrine of chances,' why
the deuce should I not succeed, for I know that she
loves me?"
</p>

<p>
He started from a deep and easy library-chair,
in which he had been seated, enjoying a pipe of
cavendish, as this idea, or chain of ideas, occurred
to him; but then calmer reflection suggested a view
of the future&mdash;his father's rage, his proud mother's
disgust, his allowance cut off, and no home for his
bride in India, but barrack accommodation or a
subaltern's bungalow.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no&mdash;by Jove, <i>that</i> would never do!" he
muttered, and reseated himself.  Yet he was
resolved to see her, if he could.  Perhaps old Winny
Braddon might not have a heart so flinty as her
mistress; and even if she had, it might not be
inaccessible to temptation; so that night, when dusk
was closing over land and sea, saw Audley Trevelyan
speeding along the Cornwall Railway, with no very
defined idea, save a desire to see, to speak with
Sybil, and to hold once again her little hand in his,
ere he left the country, it might be for ever.
</p>

<p>
The train had been unaccountably delayed; so
the hour was late, almost close on ten, when he
passed down the avenue, and found himself near
the villa.  To hope to see Sybil at that unwonted
hour was absurd; but, after having come so far, he
could not deny himself the pleasure of hovering
near the place which, from its association with her
presence, had for him so great a charm.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was with much of tender interest he
surveyed the fa√ßade of the little villa, the walls and
rose-bound portico of which glimmered white in
the light of the stars; for, as yet, the moon had not
risen, but he could not fail to observe with genuine
concern that the stables, as he passed them, and
the coach-house too, seemed empty and deserted;
for the little phaeton and its pretty ponies, so long
the pets of Sybil, had been sold, with many
other things, to furnish fees for the grasping
Mr. Sharkley: moreover, the villa was ticketed
to let.
</p>

<p>
There might be company, guests, or visitors at the
villa; if so, even at that hour, he might perhaps see
at least her figure.  But no; as he drew nearer, all
seemed dark and silent,&mdash;on the entrance floor at
least; and now the barking of a watch-dog from its
kennel near the house made him pause and consider
how strange it was that he should be prowling
thus, like a housebreaker in the night, when he
might, under happier auspices, have been an
honoured and welcome guest.
</p>

<p>
Constance and her daughter had evidently retired
for the night, lights being visible in their bedrooms
only.  That of Sybil, he had chanced to know, was
in the north wing of the house, and faced the garden,
through the iron gate of which he could see a ray
of light from her window falling on the trees,
parterres, and shrubbery.
</p>

<p>
The iron gate was locked; could he but reach her
window, he might leave a message for her pencilled
on a calling-card,&mdash;for to write by post was hopeless;
yet he should like her to know in the morning that
he had been lingering so near her.  Through the
iron bars he looked most wistfully at the lighted
window, where once or twice the candles cast a
flitting shadow on the blind.  Could he but attract
her attention, make her aware of his presence, and
exchange a word or two; perhaps he might have an
interview with her, though that would be unseemly,
and what she would not probably consent to; and
yet, after relinquishing the handful of gravel he was
about to toss against the window, he suddenly
resorted to a plan, which, if discovered, would prove
more awkward still.
</p>

<p>
The locked gate barred all entrance to the garden;
but he perceived that a great espalier had its
branches trained over all the wall, forming a solid
and veritable ladder from the ground to its summit.
The place was sequestered; the hour lonely, and
every moment of delay might be perilous, for if she
had begun to disrobe, he would be compelled to
retire, so Audley proceeded at once to scale the
barrier, that he might descend on the other side.
</p>

<p>
This proceeding was bold, rash, and rude, perhaps;
but he had no other resource if he would see
her ere he left Cornwall, which he must certainly
do, by an early train on the morrow.  With the
speed of lightning, his thoughts reverted to their
brief but pleasant past, and to every passage of their
acquaintance; their first meeting beside the
moorland tarn; her rescue from the Pixies' Hole; their
solitary walks, and that one delightful hour in yonder
conservatory, and he felt assured that she, at least,
would forgive his present temerity.
</p>

<p>
Other ideas flashed through his mind, as he
clambered from branch to branch, feeling them yielding
the while under his feet as he tore or wrenched them
from the masonry.  He felt that his real object
might be doubted; that his position was anomalous
and improper, and might compromise the girl he
loved.  What would the mess of the Hussar
regiment he had left, or that of the Light Infantry
corps he was about to join, think if they saw him
now?  What would his cold-hearted, legal "papa"&mdash;his
proud, aristocratic, and unimpressible mamma
have thought of such an adventure; and in fancy
he saw the stern grimace of the former, and the
latter using her vinaigrette and fan with unwonted
vigour, at the idea of her son visiting any lady
thus&mdash;more than all, the daughter of "Mrs. Devereaux!"
</p>

<p>
Then fears occurred to him that some change
might have taken place in the internal arrangements
at the villa, and that the window before which he
found himself, after dropping noiselessly into the
garden, might open to the room, not of Sybil, but
her mother, or old Winny Braddon!
</p>

<p>
Trusting to his doctrine of chances, he hoped this
might prove a lucky one.
</p>

<p>
The blind of the window (which opened in the
French fashion down to a flight of steps) was not
completely closed; thus he could see the whole
interior of a spacious and handsome bedroom,
nearly in the centre of which stood a dressing-table
and mirror festooned gracefully with white lace, and
before it was seated Sybil in her dark mourning
dress, with her chin resting in the hollow of one
hand, the elbow being placed upon the table.  Her
other arm hung by her side, and she seemed lost in
thought, for her eyes instead of gazing into the large
oval mirror, wherein, by the light of two tall wax
candles in ormolu holders, her own loveliness was
reflected, were bent upon vacancy, or the floor.
</p>

<p>
Sybil's usually pale and always pure complexion,
was paler now; thus her eyes, their brows and
lashes, and the masses of her hair seemed by
contrast to be very dark indeed; and the latter in rich
profusion fell over her shoulders and back below
her waist.  In the background of this pretty picture,
stood forth the white and elegant draperies of her
bed, the festooned muslin of which hung in vapour-like
folds, over curtains of rose-coloured silk, looped
up by white cords and tassels of the same material.
</p>

<p>
A glance enabled Audley to take in all these
details, and his breathing became a series of sighs
as he regarded Sybil, who sat quite motionless and
sunk in reverie.  He flattered himself that she was
thinking of him; but it was not so; she had just
concluded a sorrowful letter to Denzil, her only brother,
and her thoughts were far away with him, or with
her mamma and all their coming troubles; for all
those luxuries by which the wealth and taste, and
more than all, the love of her dead father had
surrounded them, were about to be relinquished now,
and ere long grim poverty would be staring them
gauntly in the face.
</p>

<p>
At times her nether lip quivered; the tears began
to roll over her cheeks, and as a sigh escaped her,
the heaving movement of her neck and shoulders
made more apparent their graceful character and
undulating curve.  Then suddenly, as with her quick
white fingers she was proceeding to coil up the
tresses of her hair for the night, a sound seemed to
startle her, she paused, and her eyes flashed and
dilated with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"There it is again&mdash;good heavens&mdash;what can it
be?" she exclaimed half aloud, and rising from her
seat, as Audley tapped very audibly on the window
panes for a second time.
</p>

<p>
"The deuce!" thought he, "I hope she won't
scream&mdash;for that would spoil all."
</p>

<p>
With a candle in her hand, she paused midway
between the window and her dressing-table, when
he said distinctly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is I, dearest Sybil&mdash;Audley Trevelyan&mdash;open
the window, and speak with me&mdash;but for a moment."
</p>

<p>
"Audley&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;here at this hour!" replied
Sybil, with intense astonishment, bordering on
fear.
</p>

<p>
She replaced the candle on the table, clasped her
hands, and shrunk back irresolutely, for though she
fully recognised the voice that thrilled her heart's
core, it was somewhat bewildering to hear it there
and at such a time; but summoning courage she
drew up the blind, and beheld Audley's whole figure
on the upper step, which formed the sill of her
window.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Audley&mdash;Audley&mdash;what has happened&mdash;what
brings you here again?" she asked imploringly.
</p>

<p>
"The love I bear you," said he, humbly.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot think of entering here!"
</p>

<p>
"Far from it, dearest Sybil&mdash;I have no such
thought; but pardon me for alarming you&mdash;pardon
me for intruding on you thus."
</p>

<p>
"I do pardon you, but require you to explain&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The object of such a visit at such a time," said
he, lowering his voice lest he should be overheard
in the stillness of the night.
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly," said she, weeping.
</p>

<p>
"Have you indeed discarded me&mdash;withdrawn your
heart from me, and for ever, Sybil?"
</p>

<p>
"What would you have me to do, Audley?"
</p>

<p>
"There is an arbour in the garden&mdash;throw a
shawl over you, and grant me but a minute to say a
few farewell words."
</p>

<p>
"The moment you first asked for has become a
minute&mdash;so would the minute soon become an
hour."
</p>

<p>
"In pity to me, Sybil," urged Audley, with
clasped hands.
</p>

<p>
After a little indecision, seeming to listen and
perceive that all was still, she threw a shawl over
her head, unbolted the French sash, and stepped
forth into the garden, where now the light of an
uprisen moon fell in a bright flood upon the grass
plots, the shining evergreens, and tipped all the
leafless trees with liquid silver.  There seemed a divine
peace over all the earth and sky; but the hearts of
these two young people were sad and aching, while
Audley pressed a long and silent kiss upon her
upturned face, as he led her towards the bower in
question.
</p>

<p>
"I leave this to-morrow, Sybil," said he, as he
seated himself by her side, and took her hands
caressingly in his own, "and I could not resist
the craving, the desire to see you once again, and
explain much that my returned letters were meant
to elucidate to you and your mamma&mdash;that I have
no share in the spirit of animosity&mdash;hostility&mdash;how
shall I term it?&mdash;cherished by my family against
you and yours.  With this family quarrel, for so
shall I style it, I have nothing to do, and you, dear
Sybil, have nothing to do.  The employment of a
legal wretch like Sharkley was, of course, a fatal
mistake, making much public that need never have
been so, and tending greatly to complicate and
embitter our affairs."
</p>

<p>
"My poor mamma had none to advise her,"
urged Sybil, not heeding a slight tone of
reprehension in what Audley said.
</p>

<p>
"How fortunate has been the chance that led me
to you to-night!" he whispered in her ear.
</p>

<p>
"But to what end or purpose do we meet at all?"
</p>

<p>
"Fettered as I am&mdash;most true!"
</p>

<p>
Audley could only sigh deeply and press her to
his breast.
</p>

<p>
"Then you&mdash;you love me still?" said Sybil, as
her slender fingers strayed among his hair, the
action in itself a mute caress.
</p>

<p>
"My darling&mdash;I have never ceased to love you!"
he exclaimed, gazing tenderly on the pure pale face
whose features he could see distinctly, even amid
the obscurity of the bower.  Her head drooped on
his shoulder, and they sat for some minutes quite
silent, and full of thoughts that were beyond
utterance; yet Audley's delight was not without alloy.
He felt that he loved her dearly, and yet, with all
the joy of the time, there mingled a selfish regret
that he had won her so completely, as their love
could never be a successful one.
</p>

<p>
"And you leave this to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Her voice was broken and tremulous.  Audley
became deeply moved as he heard her weep; and he
began to think, as better impulses inspired him,
was it possible that he could relinquish or sacrifice
a girl so soft and tender, so loving and true, for
"Mrs. Grundy and Society?" and had he actually
at one time&mdash;young-officer-like&mdash;felt a little glow of
satisfaction when she returned the eye of Vishnu,
and he felt himself once more <i>free</i>!
</p>

<p>
In his vacillation there was every prospect of the
proposal to elope being made, but prudence made
him pause, and an observation of Sybil's changed
the current of his ideas.
</p>

<p>
"Your father has acted most cruelly to poor
mamma," said Sybil; "and most unjustly to his
own brother's memory."
</p>

<p>
"My father is a&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh hush, Audley," said Sybil.
</p>

<p>
What epithet or adjective he was about to use in
irritation at the chances of his allowance being cut
off, we are unable to record, for Sybil's quick little
hand intercepted it on his lips.
</p>

<p>
"And now we must separate&mdash;you will find the
key inside the garden gate, so no more escalading;
oh, leave me," she urged, "for if you were
discovered&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One kiss more&mdash;one promise to remember me
when I am gone."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Audley, could I ever forget you?"
</p>

<p>
They were lingering now midway between the
bower and the house, and the full splendour of the
moonlight fell around them.
</p>

<p>
"And you will take back your ring," he whispered;
and once more the eye of Vishnu glittered on the
hand of Sybil.  "Keep it as the memento of a poor
fellow who loves you well&mdash;and you must do
something more for me."
</p>

<p>
"In what way, Audley?" asked Sybil, pausing on
the upper step, and near the still open window of
her room.
</p>

<p>
"Keep poor Rajah for me; my lady mother won't
abide the dog, and I can't take him back all the way
to India, as I am perhaps going overland by the
desert; and now my beloved girl&mdash;dear, dear
Sybil&mdash;I must leave you, perhaps never to see you
again."
</p>

<p>
A desperate calm seemed to come over Sybil, as
she replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Situated as we are; related as we are, and
enemies as my mamma and your parents must ever
be, it is indeed better that we should meet no
more&mdash;yet part as friends."
</p>

<p>
"As friends&mdash;oh, Sybil&mdash;as friends!" murmured
Audley, becoming more excited as she grew calm.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;this meeting and parting will form a pleasant
memory to look back upon, in years to come,
when we are far apart."
</p>

<p>
Often in after times did these words come back to
the heart of Audley Trevelyan.
</p>

<p>
"And you will always wear my ring?"
</p>

<p>
"For life&mdash;dear cousin Audley&mdash;farewell."
</p>

<p>
She was about to close the casement, her hands
trembling and her cheeks ghastly pale, when he
urged,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I must write to you&mdash;under cover to some
one&mdash;permit me&mdash;oh, permit me?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot&mdash;I cannot," she replied, with a torrent
of tears.
</p>

<p>
"I must&mdash;pardon my importunity, darling."
</p>

<p>
"Go&mdash;go, I entreat you&mdash;good-bye&mdash;farewell."
</p>

<p>
She was about to shut the French sash, when a
voice startled her, by exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God&mdash;what is this I see?" and as Sybil
started back, Audley found himself confronted by
Constance, in her dressing-gown, for she had entered
the room, candle in hand, having been roused by the
sound of their voices at the open window.
</p>

<p>
This <i>d√©nouement</i>, so unexpected, was very awkward,
and liable to the most serious misconstruction;
so Audley's doctrine of chances proved a failure
here.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
MISCONCEPTION.
</h3>

<p>
Little could Sybil or Audley have foreseen how
fatal was to be the ultimate termination of this
night's adventure.
</p>

<p>
The usually sweet and placid little face of
Constance was now inflamed with rage and
distorted by grief.  Her colour came and went, like
her breath, rapidly; and through their tears, her
dark eyes were sparkling with fire.
</p>

<p>
A painful silence was maintained by the three for
a few moments.
</p>

<p>
Sybil scarcely understood the cause of her
mother's terrible excitement, while Audley, who knew
more of life and the world's ways, was filled with
genuine shame and mortification on finding that
his presence there was misunderstood, and the
perfect purity of his intentions misconceived or
entirely doubted.
</p>

<p>
Constance, on the other hand, was full of
indignation against him for taking what she not
unnaturally believed to be a most unwarrantable and
unfair advantage of their now false position, their
growing monetary troubles and disgrace, to insult
her helpless daughter; she was furious, therefore,
as a tigress about to be robbed of her young, and
though fiery in her wrath, yet stately and proud in
her bearing as a little tragedy queen.
</p>

<p>
"How, sir, have you dared to come hither after
being forbidden my house?" she exclaimed, in the
full belief that Audley, when entreating only that he
might write to Sybil, had been forcing a passage into
her chamber; "and why at such an untimeous hour
as this?  Oh shame, sir! shame!  Have you neither
honour nor compassion?  Could you forget that the
poor girl you pretended to love was your own
cousin?"  Then changing suddenly from upbraiding
to scorn, she added, "Truly the legal snake Downie
Trevelyan is well represented by his son, who would
break into my daughter's room like a thief in the
night, and seek perhaps to steal her honour, after
having stolen her patrimony!  Begone, sir, instantly,
ere I summon aid and have you exposed&mdash;it may be,
arrested."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, madam, do permit me to explain all this,"
urged Audley almost piteously; but Constance, in
the full tide of her indignation would listen to
nothing.  She showered upon him reproaches, and,
summoning Winny Braddon, ordered her to ring the
long disused house-bell, cast loose the watch-dog,
and bring assistance.  Never had the terrified Sybil
seen her constitutionally gentle, placid, and ladylike
mother in so wild a gust of passion; and with
clasped hands and colourless face, she turned her
weeping eyes alternately, with imploring glances,
from her to Audley, who seemed to feel acutely that
his position was absurd, dangerous, and pitiful; so
he was filled by an emotion of shame till it took the
phase of irritation.
</p>

<p>
"Leave us, Audley, I entreat you&mdash;see, mamma is
seriously ill!" said Sybil, on perceiving Constance
press her hands upon her temples, displaying, as
she did so, the snowy whiteness of her taper arms,
while tottering into a chair.  Audley gave the
scared girl a glance full of agony in expression, and
said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I shall write and explain all, and she will do
me justice when calmer; to-night, any attempts at
elucidation were utterly vain.  I am to blame for
my rashness and selfishness in compromising you
thus; but not so much to blame as she thinks,
however.  Your heart at least will excuse and plead
for me; and now, dearest Sybil, a long, long&mdash;farewell!"
</p>

<p>
He was gone!
</p>

<p>
Sybil stayed not to listen to his departing steps,
but sprang to the side of her mother, who, weakened
by past sorrow and emotion, had felt this episode in
all its real and imaginary details, too much for the
nervous system.  She had fainted, and now lay back
in her chair whiter than a lily.
</p>

<p>
Full of humiliation and anger, Audley retired,
not as he had come, by scaling the wall, but by the
garden-gate, which he unlocked, and then quitted
the place, resolving to write to Constance fully on
the morrow.  Irresolute and infirm of purpose, he
continued to linger near the villa, as the chill hours
of the morning succeeded each other, and it was
far advanced ere he thought of seeking the vicinity
of the train that was to take him home.  He saw
the day-dawn spread over the sea, and the shadows
of the land, with its rocks and precipices cast, by
the level sunlight, far across its brightening waters.
He saw the gray mist rising from the valleys and
rolling up the brown mountain sides, as it did so
revealing new ravines and hollows it had hitherto
concealed.  He saw the red rays light up the mighty
headland known as Willapark Point; all the barren
ridge of Resparvell Down, and all the rocks and
foam, and broken shore about Tintagel and Trevana
tinted with marvellous beauty, and varied light and
shadow, by the morning sun; and inland, Little
Minster church, secluded in its nook among the hills;
and from an eminence which he ascended, he could
see amid the dun-coloured moorland, the lonely
tarn and huge rock pillar where he had first met
Sybil Devereaux; and with these all her presence,
and the nameless magnetic charm she possessed in
her own person, came vividly home to his heart.
When the hedgerows that intersected the landscape
would be green and those enclosures of stone coped
with turf in the Cornish fashion, would be covered
with wild violets, daisies, and kingcups; and when
yonder groves of sycamore, ash, and elm, and the
cherry orchards should be covered with the bloom
of summer, half the world would be lying between
him and Sybil!
</p>

<p>
He stifled the emotions that were rising within
him, hurried to the railway, and throwing himself
into a well-cushioned first-class carriage (after
"tipping" the guard, that he might be free from
intrusion), overcome and weary with the excitement
and events of the past night, he sank into
a profound slumber, and reached home in time
to have a refresher of iced brandy and soda from
Jasper Funnel before that stolid functionary rung
the breakfast-bell, and before his somewhat unusual
absence had been discovered by any one save his
valet.
</p>

<p>
From Rhoscadzhel he wrote immediately to
Constance, explaining that the sole object of his
visit to Sybil was to bid her farewell, and entreating
her pardon for the misconception and annoyance he
had caused.  To enable her to reply, he delayed his
departure two days, but in vain.  However, the
circumstance of his humble and contrite letter being
returned, not to himself, but under cover and
unopened to his father (whom she addressed as
"D. Trevelyan, Esq., Barrister-at-Law"), thereby causing
a fresh family explosion, completed the full measure
of his chagrin; and the young officer felt deeply
stung by the contemptuous manner in which it was
tossed to him across the breakfast-table.
</p>

<p>
"There, sir," said Downie, bitterly; "there is
your precious production; and remember that a
fool should never post his letters till twenty-four
hours after they are written.  I suppose we shall
next have notice of an action filed against you, for
breach of promise by that scoundrel
Sharkley&mdash;Devereaux versus Trevelyan!"
</p>

<p>
That evening saw Audley depart from Rhoscadzhel.
</p>

<p>
He repaired at once to the dep√¥t of his regiment,
then lying in Tilbury Barracks, that quaint old
tumble-down fort, whose handsome gateway, like a stately
Temple Bar, has faced the river for nearly three
centuries; and there he strove to forget Cornwall
and all the trouble he had encountered, amid the
dissipation and amusements afforded by English
garrison life to every wealthy young man.
</p>

<p>
Thus, when off duty, his days were consumed in
tandem-driving, pigeon, cricket, or rowing matches;
<i>d√©je√ªners</i>, an occasional steeple-chase in Essex or
Kent (or a day's leave in London to see the
Trecarrels); while his nights were devoted to dining
out, dancing, and drinking, billiards, and garrison
balls, private theatricals, and, consequently, a fierce
flirtation with an occasional pretty actress, despite
rouge and pearl-powder.
</p>

<p>
It has been said that "at no time is a man so
prone to fall in love as immediately after his being
jilted;" but many a fair one tried her blandishments
on Audley in vain; for he had been separated by
adverse fortune from, and not jilted by, the object
of his attachment.  A long journey was before
him, and he doubted not that he would get over
the memory of Sybil in time.
</p>

<p>
So passed the weeks till he would have to go to
India in the spring of the year; and thus he strove
to forget her, who was yet to exercise a wondrous
influence on his future life; with the recollection of
those kisses that had thrilled his heart to the core,
and those soft dark eyes whose beauty made even
silence eloquent.
</p>

<p>
And did he achieve this complete forgetfulness?
</p>

<p>
Time and our story will show.

CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><br />
REVERSES.
</h3>

<p>
Meanwhile how fared it with poor Sybil, who
knew not whether he was at home or abroad, or
had already forgotten her, and married perhaps the
more sparkling and showy Rose Trecarrel?
</p>

<p>
Re-addressing Audley's letter was fated to be the
last action the right hand of Constance was to
perform in this world.
</p>

<p>
For the two days subsequent to the episode just
related she remained in bed, exhausted apparently,
sadder and lower in spirit than usual; and on the
morning of the third, Sybil, when drawing back the
curtains to see if she were asleep or awake, to
receive her daily kiss and join in prayer, was
inexpressibly shocked and terrified to perceive a
peculiar fixity in one eye, and that a corner of her
still beautiful mouth was strangely drawn down on
one side.
</p>

<p>
Paralysis had supervened, and poor Constance
had totally lost the use of one half of her body!
</p>

<p>
Summoned in hot haste, the village doctor came,
with his stereotyped professional expression of
sympathy.  He felt her pulse, repeater in hand, and
ominously shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, do you think there is danger?" asked
Sybil, in intense agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, child&mdash;come this way," said he, and led
her from the room.
</p>

<p>
"God help me, sir&mdash;you have something terrible
to tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"I have, indeed; but nerve yourself, for she has
none to depend upon now but you."
</p>

<p>
"None, indeed, save One who is in Heaven."
</p>

<p>
Her disease, he said, was embalism; it came
from the region of the heart, and had been gradually
but rapidly forming in her system for some time
past; anxiety and sorrow had doubtless induced it.
and some recent excitement&mdash;that night affair, of
which the doctor knew not&mdash;had brought it to a
head.  A second shock, he added, must inevitably
prove fatal!
</p>

<p>
With dilated eyes and clasped hands, the unhappy
girl listened to this sentence of death, for such it
sounded in her overstrained ear and to her aching
heart, as the doctor spoke it in an impressive and
never-to-be-forgotten whisper, in a room adjoining
that in which the sufferer lay.  He then paused,
and gazed with much of genuine sympathy into the
pale face of the startled listener; perhaps he was
mentally speculating upon the probable future of
this lovely girl, with whose sad family history he
was quite familiar now.
</p>

<p>
And what was embalism, she asked, in a low and
intensely agitated voice.
</p>

<p>
A species of weed, or little fungus, that grew in
the upper region of the heart, from whence it passed,
by minute fibres, fine as a gossamer thread, through
the blood-vessels, till, by choking the passage of one
of them, there ensued the dire effect they had seen.
And was it curable?  No; yet the patient might
linger for months; and, he added, that Sybil must
control her grief, nor let the sufferer see by it that
danger was apprehended.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was gone; but he was to come again,
and for some minutes Sybil sat like one transformed
to stone, unable even to weep, or reply to the excited
questions, showered upon her by Winny Braddon,
so stunning was the sense of this sudden and
unrealisable calamity.  She was, perhaps, on the very eve
of losing her mamma&mdash;her sole relative and friend&mdash;that
beautiful, and gentle, and loving mamma, to
whom she had been quite as much like a sister and
companion as a daughter; for, though a parent,
Constance was still so young in appearance and
manner, and, till their late calamities had come to
pass, naturally so gay, happy, and buoyant in spirit,
despite the secret of her wedded life.
</p>

<p>
She rushed to the bedroom, and clasped the
sufferer in her arms, pillowing her head upon her
bosom, and so for hours she hung about her, that
she might have the melancholy joy of her society
while yet spared to her; and for a time she almost
forgot the grave warning given so recently, to
control her emotions, nor excite the now passive
and helpless Constance, who, ignorant alike of her
own condition and danger, and propped up by
cushions, could but gaze at her wistfully, and make
efforts to speak that were intensely painful to the
hearer.
</p>

<p>
The doctor had assured her, that "to expect an
ultimate recovery was vain; that her mother's life
was but a thing of time now&mdash;as it is with us all,"
he added; yet, hoping against hope and these sad
words, Sybil was unremitting in her attentions to
her parent.  Days there were when she rallied a
little, and could even move her right hand, but only
to become worse subsequently, and to find her
breathing more laborious and painful.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was an honest though not brilliant
man, and did his best for the patient, without thinking
of fee or reward.  Sybil, in her intense anxiety,
doubted his skill: but how was she to procure that
of others?  There were, she knew, great physicians
in London and elsewhere, but she was destitute of
the means for employing them.  Times there were,
when, in her desperation, she thought of writing to
Audley; but she knew that her mother would never
have approved of such a proceeding; and their
parting had been so strange, that she shrunk from
the idea as suddenly as it had been conceived, and
she thought, as she whispered in her heart the
words of a once familiar song, that hers was&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A love that took an early root,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had an early doom,<br />
  Like trees that never come to fruit,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And early shed their bloom&mdash;<br />
  Of vanished hopes and sunny smiles,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All lost for evermore;<br />
  Like ships that sailed for sunny isles<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never saw their shore."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She thought, too of the fatherly old soldier,
General Trecarrel, and then as quickly remembered
that he had been present during that humiliating
interview at Rhoscadzhel; but any idea of writing
to him for advice was crushed finally, when a stray
newspaper announced one day, that the General
"and his family" had sailed in the <i>Netley</i> transport
for India, his extra aide-de-camp, the Honourable
Mr. Audley Trevelyan, having proceeded overland,
to serve on his staff in the new campaign against
the Afghans.
</p>

<p>
Something of secret satisfaction mingled with the
sorrow and fear of the lonely girl, as she read this
paragraph&mdash;which she did a great many
times&mdash;satisfaction that Audley had not gone in the same
vessel with these gay Trecarrels, which he could
easily have done, if so disposed; sorrow, that they
were so completely and hopelessly separated now,
and fear for the events of the coming campaign in
which he was to serve, and more than probably her
brother Denzil, too.  Sybil could little suppose that
it was purposely to avoid being quizzed by the
Trecarrels about herself, and to avoid the imputation,
or too probable danger, consequent to a long
voyage with two such handsome and enterprising
flirts as Mabel and Rose were known to be, that he
had, with a few brother officers, started for the East
overland, a less easy and luxurious journey then
than it is now.
</p>

<p>
But Sybil was soon compelled by the exigencies
of their situation to exert herself beyond her years
and experience, for creditors, we have said, had
become clamorous.  Everything that could be
spared was to be turned into money, and they were
to seek another and more humble home.  All the
beautiful art-treasures collected by the taste of her
parents in their continental wanderings, the oak and
marqueterie cabinets, the chaste china of Dresden
and S√®vres, the quaint Majolica vases, and alabaster
groups, with all the most valued household gods,
were despatched to the nearest market town in
charge of the useful Mr. Sharkly, and disposed of
with a ruinous commission to that somewhat
"seedy" personage! and a little time after saw the
pretty villa, so long the abode of so much peaceful
and sequestered happiness, in the possession of
strangers, while Sybil and her mamma were content
to locate them in a small cottage which they rented
from old Michael Treherne, the miner, and furnished
in the plainest manner; but all their debts
were cleared, and even Denzil's Indian outfit paid.
</p>

<p>
To Constance all places were pretty much alike
now, for she had become listless and indifferent to
external objects; but times there were when much
of exasperation mingled with Sybil's grief, at the
thought that her mamma&mdash;she so gently bred and
nurtured, and so petted by her drowned father&mdash;she,
who should then be in Rhoscadzhel, surrounded
by every appliance that wealth, luxury, skill, and
rank could furnish, was now in her desolate widowhood,
and sore extremity, the inmate of a poor and
sordid cottage.
</p>

<p>
Thus day succeeded day, and weeks rolled on
without any change, at least for the better&mdash;weeks
which seemed so long, heavy and monotonous, that to
Sybil the world and time appeared to stand still.  No
letters came from Denzil now, for he had marched
up-country somewhere, and India was not then what
it has been since the Great Mutiny of the Sepoys,
intersected by railways and telegraph wires; but
Denzil's last epistle was full of unusual interest to
Sybil and her mamma.
</p>

<p>
He had, of course, been duly acquainted by the
former of all that had occurred at home, with the
startling revelations consequent to his father's
journey to Montreal, and his death at sea; and now
he should probably meet, ere long, this cousin of
his, this Audley Trevelyan, for they belonged to the
same regiment, and it was, perhaps, to form a
portion of Trecarrel's brigade.  And <i>how</i> were they
to meet&mdash;as friends and brother officers, as relations
or enemies?&mdash;for Audley's father occupied <i>his</i>
(Denzil's) place in the world or in society, at least.
</p>

<p>
Relations&mdash;pshaw!&mdash;could they ever be aught but
foes? was the young man's immediate thought, and
his sister's boding fear.  And so his father was
gone&mdash;his good, kind father, his friend, companion,
and preceptor in many a manly sport.  How often
had they rode and rambled, shot and fished together
in Calabria, the Abruzzi, and Switzerland, and at
home in sturdy Cornwall, so many thousand miles
away!  Only those who are so far from home&mdash;so
far away as India, with all its strange external
influences and objects&mdash;can know how keen, and
strong, and tender, to the young at least, are the
ties of home and kindred, especially as the home-ties
decrease in number by distance, change, and death.
</p>

<p>
Dead&mdash;his father dead!  The "governor," as he
had styled him, like "other fellows" at Sandhurst,
his "dear old dad," as he called him in the home
that was a broken home now; and as the pleasant
face, that he never more would look upon, with
years of past affection, came back to memory, the
lad had covered his face with his hands, and wept.
</p>

<p>
"It is only when we have been long at sea and
have lost sight of Europe," wrote Denzil, "ay,
dearest Sybil, even of Europe, which seems all one
country and one home to us, that the Anglo-Indian
feels his banishment has fairly begun, and he is to
be, henceforth, as some fellow has it, 'among the
dusky people of Ind, with whom we have no
traditions, no religious, few domestic, and scarcely any
moral sentiments in common, and whose very
costume (want of it, sometimes, I should say) is only
characteristic of a much greater difference of inward
nature.'  And so I am actually by birth a lord&mdash;a
lord!  I have thought, and many visions of future
greatness have floated through my mind&mdash;and dear
mamma is a lady&mdash;-Dowager Lady Lamorna.  How
odd it sounds.  Are we all losing our identity; and
how is all this to be proved?  The past mystery
nearly cost me my life when I first joined, and in
this fashion:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Bob Waller, one of ours, a pleasant but sometimes
supercilious fellow, asked me one evening in
the mess bungalow, if 'my people were from the
Channel Islands?'
</p>

<p>
"'No,' replied I, colouring, for I always felt that
some mystery existed about us; 'but why do you
ask?'
</p>

<p>
"'The name sounds like a French one,' replied
Waller.
</p>

<p>
"'We are connected somehow with Montreal.'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, that explains it,' rejoined Waller.
</p>

<p>
"'There is nothing to explain,' said I, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"'Think not?&mdash;well&mdash;have a cigar?'
</p>

<p>
"I roughly, perhaps, declined it, so Waller
returned to the charge by saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Your father was once in the Cornish Light
Infantry, you say?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes&mdash;a captain&mdash;some twenty years ago.'
</p>

<p>
"'Strange.  I have looked all through the Army
Lists, and can find no such name in the corps.'
</p>

<p>
"This assertion exasperated me (I afterwards
found it correct), and I challenged him to meet me
the next morning in a grove of peepul trees, outside
the cantonments; but duelling days are over&mdash;the
affair got wind, and each of us was placed under
arrest within his own compound till we exchanged
mutual promises.  Bob Waller and I are excellent
friends now, and at the moment I am writing, he is
sitting opposite me in his shirt and drawers, for we
are having a glass of brandy-pawnee&mdash;the alcohol
with water&mdash;and a couple of Chinsworah cheroots
together; and I must close now, to catch the
dauk-boat&mdash;as we call the mail."
</p>

<p>
This was Denzil's last letter, and after its arrival
the weeks continued to roll monotonously on, and
still found Sybil watching, with unwearied and
unrepining zeal, by what she knew to be a bed of death.
</p>

<p>
Constance could speak but little, and then only
to murmur her fears and prayers for the future of
her daughter.
</p>

<p><a id="chap27"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><br />
ALONE!
</h3>

<p>
At last there came an evening which Sybil was
never to forget.
</p>

<p>
She had been, for the tenth and last time, at the
nearest market-town, where, in the shop windows of
a druggist, who combined the dispensing of
medicines with groceries, and the cares of a
circulating library with those of a post office, she
had been fain to display some of her sketches for
sale, that she might procure certain little comforts
for her ailing mother in their penury.  All had been
offered to the local public in succession, even to that
one which pourtrayed the lonely tarn and rock-pillar,
where she had first met Audley, when he came to
apologise for his dog's intrusion (why keep such a
souvenir now?), and all had been offered in vain.
Pleased with the girl's beauty and sweetness of
manner, the shopman willingly enough displayed
her productions (as decorations, perhaps) in his
windows; and there they had grown yellow,
blistered, and fly-blown, till they were completely
spoiled.  Each market-day she had hoped that
some enterprising Hobnail or Chawbacon might
fancy one of her sketches of some well-known
locality, to ornament his dwelling, but only to be
disappointed, for art seemed to be sorely at a
discount in the land of Tre, Pol, and Pen.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the day in question, Sybil was
returning from the town to their new home with a
heavy heart.  Not a sketch had been sold, and her
purse was almost empty; the rain was falling
heavily, and a cold, keen blast from the Bristol
Channel swept over the desolate and open moorland
she had to traverse; and her tears were mingling
with the large drops that plashed on her delicate
face and sodden hair.  She had resolved that on
the morrow&mdash;come what might&mdash;she should take
means to dispose of Audley's farewell gift, the
returned engagement ring; the diamond, she knew,
was a valuable one, too much so to find a purchaser
in their now humble neighbourhood; but the doctor,
or the friendly druggist, who had her luckless
sketches, would perhaps advise her in the matter;
and with a sigh, in which sorrow mingled with
relief and hope, she hastened onward.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of the district by which she had to
pass to reach their present abode, was but
ill-calculated to raise her spirit on a wet, stormy, and
gloomy evening.  In the distance rose the rough
granite summits of the Row Tor and Bron Welli, each
nearly some fourteen hundred feet in height, the
sides of the former all covered by enormous blocks,
the mightiest in Cornwall, piled over each other a
very wilderness of spheroidal masses&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confusedly hurled,<br />
  The fragments of a former world."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Over these mountain summits, the descending
evening mists, cold and grey, had replaced the
farewell rays of the red sun as he sunk beyond the sea;
the appearance of the former, made Sybil quicken
her steps, lest she should be overtaken on the moor,
for then she should be able to see but a few yards
before her, so sudden and dense are those floating
vapours in Cornwall; and the bogholes were perilous.
On either side of the way&mdash;a mere cart track&mdash;stood
those lines of upright stones, which are
ranged along it at regular distances, and extend all
the way from Watergate, over the moor, having been
erected at some remote period to mark the path in
misty weather; and with a new but not unaccountable
foreboding in her heart, for like Constance she
was of a delicate organisation and had keen perceptions,
Sybil hastened on, till she experienced a kind
of sad relief on seeing the light that shone from the
window of the little room where now her ailing
mother lay, and where kind old Winny Braddon sat
and watched.
</p>

<p>
Pausing at the threshold, she threw aside her
drenched cloak and hat, and strove to smooth her
wetted hair, ere she stealthily opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"How is dear mamma now, Winny?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"She sleeps still."
</p>

<p>
"Still?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;the poor darling; but in her sleep she has
been muttering much of the past&mdash;dreaming, I suppose;
oh, my poor <i>chealveen</i>, you're wet, and cold,
and weary too."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't mind me, Winny; but tell me all
about mamma."
</p>

<p>
"What more have I to tell you?" asked the old
woman, mournfully; "but you&mdash;you must have tea,
or something warm; you will kill yourself at this
rate, and then I shall have two to nurse instead of
one."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, I want nothing; let me but change
these wet things, and then I shall take your place
beside mamma's bed."
</p>

<p>
Sad, sad indeed, was Sybil's heart on this night,
for it was a melancholy one in many ways.  As she
sat by the plain unornamented bed wherein Constance
lay, and surveyed, by the light of a single
candle, the humble little room, destitute of cornice
and all decoration, with its scanty furniture, she
doubted at times her own identity, or whether this
was not all a dream, from which she must awake to
find herself at home in the villa&mdash;at home, in that
pretty room where Audley saw her last, and
where the windows opened to a beautiful flower
garden.
</p>

<p>
And was this poor, wan and wasted invalid, so
helpless and so passive now, her once merry and
handsome mamma, whose hands had so loved to
stray among her hair; who had hung over her little
cot in infancy, and whose nightly and morning
kisses would never come again; whose companionship
she had shared like a younger sister, and with
whom she had spent so many happy years?
</p>

<p>
All was very still in that sick room.
</p>

<p>
In the hall, a great old-fashioned Dutch clock
tick-tacked slowly and monotonously; without, the
night was wild, and prolonged and angry blasts of
wind swept over the desolate moor with a bellowing
sound, that made the sleeper stir uneasily; and lost
in thought, the pale girl sat there listening to the
blast, the rain, and the clock, sounds that repeated
themselves over and over again in dreary uniformity.
</p>

<p>
On this night she thought much of her absent
brother.  She had written to him that very
morning, imploring him, if he met with Audley, to be
friendly with him, as their secret claims to the
name of Trevelyan and the Lamorna peerage, could
never be established now; and thus she hoped and
begged that he, like herself, would retain their
mother's name of Devereaux, as they had always
been known by it and by no other.
</p>

<p>
Sybil must have dropped asleep, for she started
to find the old clock wheezing and whirring as it
struck the hour of three; and shivered, for she was
stiff and chilled; the candle had nearly burned
down, and what Winny Braddon would have called
"a shroud" had guttered over the side of it; and
Sybil felt fully how cheerless and depressing is the
slow approach of morning in a sickroom&mdash;more than
all, of a morning so hopeless as each successive one
proved now.
</p>

<p>
The rain and the wind were over; the clouds were
divided in heaven, and the stars shone out brightly;
the weather was calm, and no sound came to Sybil's
ear save the tick-tack of the old clock, and the
breathing of the sufferer, which seemed laborious and
irregular.
</p>

<p>
Shading the light with her hand, Sybil stole a
glance at her mother's face, and an alteration in its
expression filled her with such terror, that a cry
almost escaped her.  The mouth was more distorted,
and the eyes&mdash;for Constance was quite awake&mdash;were
regarding her with a strange, keen, sad and
weird expression.  At that moment, however, Winny,
hearing her young mistress stir, appeared at the door
of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Winny!" whispered Sybil in an agony of
alarm, "there is a change come over mamma; go&mdash;go
at once for the doctor, ere it is perhaps too&mdash;too
late!  No, no; you are old and frail, and the moor
is wet," she suddenly added; "get me my hat and
cloak&mdash;I, myself, shall fly for him."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, darling; stay by her side&mdash;she may not
be long spared to you, and I shall go.  Past three
in the morning, and dark as midnight.  I'll take a
lantern and be off."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, Winny, thank you!" said the
girl, kissing the old woman's shrivelled cheek, and
with hasty and trembling fingers assisting to muffle
her in a cloak, and to light a lantern; and then
seeing her issue forth upon her errand with all the
speed her love and charity inspired, and her old
limbs could exert; and with clasped hands, and a
prayer upon her lips, Sybil at the door for a little
space watched the lantern (Winny's figure was soon
lost amid the gloom), as its fitful light fell in
succession upon the grey, upright blocks of the stone
avenue that marked the desolate moorland road, till
at last it diminished to a spark, like an <i>ignis-fatuus</i>,
and then she stole back once more to her mother's
side.
</p>

<p>
The left arm of the latter was outside the coverlet
now, and her hand, so snowy in its whiteness, rested
on the edge of the bed.  With her eyes full of tears,
and her heart full of earnest prayer, Sybil knelt
reverently down to kiss it, taking the hand between
her own caressingly.
</p>

<p>
How <i>heavy</i> that little hand felt now!

<p>
Cold, too&mdash;its touch startled her.  She threw
back the curtain; her mother lay motionless with
jaw somewhat relaxed, her eyes still, and staring
upward.  Death was too surely there, but Sybil had
never looked upon it, and only felt wildly startled and
terrified.  She tried to raise the head, but felt
powerless.
</p>

<p>
"Oh mamma&mdash;dear mamma, do not leave me!
Come back to me, mamma&mdash;come back to me!" she
exclaimed, in a voice the tones of which seemed
discordant and shrill to her own ear.  "Is
this sleep or death? oh, no! no, not
death&mdash;NOT death!"
</p>

<p>
But it was so, and how terribly pale, serene and
still, how calm and peacefully she lay, with something
of a smile gathering on her lips, like one "who
had ended the business of life before death, and who,
when the hour cometh, hath nothing to do but to
die."
</p>

<p>
Bewildered and awe-struck, with a wild beating in
her heart and in her brain, Sybil drew back; then
she stood still and listened.
</p>

<p>
There was no sound save the pulsations in her
own breast, and the odious ticking of the old wooden
clock, which now seemed to have become unnaturally
loud.  Then emotions which appeared to be stifling
came over her, and a craven terror which she could
not describe, and of which she was afterwards
ashamed, as if it had been a sin or crime, possessed
her, and she fled from the room, and from the house
itself, for she could not remain alone with the dead;
and so, crouching down on the wet, damp soil near
the entrance door, she muffled her head in her
shawl.
</p>

<p>
A ray of light was streaming out into the darkness,
but she could not look upon it, for it came where
the dead was lying, and where the light of life had
passed away.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven help me&mdash;heaven help me!  I am now
alone; most utterly alone!" she moaned, and bent
her head between her hands, as if the dark waves of
thought were flowing over it.
</p>

<p>
Alas! how much may be condensed&mdash;how much
felt, and yet never expressed by that one little
word&mdash;<i>alone</i>!
</p>

<p>
Sybil, however, fainted from excess of emotion, for
she was discovered there crouching in a heap by
the doctor and Winny, when they arrived together,
more than one hour after, when the distant horizon
was grey with the coming dawn, and the white fog
was rolling along the sides of the Kow Tor and Bron
Welli; and thus, in insensibility, had she found, for
a time, oblivion to all her sorrows.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
